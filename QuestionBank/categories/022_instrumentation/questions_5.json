It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. RA is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and only then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of this system despite possible conflicting ATC instructions. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, nonetheless pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology.",

All of the remaining options would be green. Please let us know if you come across this question. At the moment from feedback and commonly used EGPWS systems, we think the best option is \"below the aircraft altitude by less than the required obstacle clearance.\", as the aircraft being only 500 ft above terrain is not acceptable terrain clearance, and any yellow regions are either that bad (aircraft 500 ft above terrain) or worse (aircraft as low as 2000 ft below terrain) for terrain clearance. When the airplane is 500 feet or more above the highest terrain in the selected display range, terrain is depicted in green, and colour density varies based on terrain elevation: Solid green: Highest elevation terrain High-density dotted green: Intermediate elevation terrain Low-density dotted green: Lowest elevation terrain Black: No significant terrain When the airplane is less than 500 feet above the highest terrain in the selected display range, colour and density vary based on terrain elevation vs. airplane altitude: Solid red: Look-ahead terrain warning active Solid amber: Look-ahead terrain caution active Dotted red: Terrain more than 2000 feet above the airplane's current altitude Dotted amber: Terrain 500 feet (250 feet with gear down) below to 2000 feet above the airplane's current altitude. Dotted green: Terrain from 2000 feet below to 500 feet (250 feet with gear down) below the airplane's current altitude Black: No significant terrain Dotted magenta: No terrain data available Note 1: This explanation is sourced from the Boeing 737 FCOM.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated in an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The Resolution Advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square.",

GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) (figure 1) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Seven main conditions give rise to audible and visual alerts. These conditions are described as MODES: - MODE 1 - Excessive Barometric Descent Rate - MODE 2 - Excessive Terrain Closure Rate - MODE 3 - Altitude Loss after Take-off or Go-around - MODE 4A - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Landing Gear Not down - MODE 4B - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Flaps Not in Landing Configuration - MODE 5 - Below Glide Slope Deviation Alert This mode alerts the flight crew of a descent of more than 1.3 dots below an ILS glide slope. AURAL ALERT - “GLIDE SLOPE” The mode may be cancelled or inhibited by pressing 'G/S MODE' pb on the overhead panel. (figure 2) - MODE 6A - Below Selected Minimum Radio Altitude - MODE 6B Altitude Call-outs and Bank Angle Alert - MODE 7 Windshear Alerting",

TCAS alerts the crew to possible conflicting traffic. TCAS interrogates operating transponders in other airplanes, tracks the other airplanes by analyzing the transponder replies, and predicts the flight paths and positions.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the Resolution Advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The Resolution Advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. When a threat is detected, RA instructions will be announced on the appropriate TCAS II display in each of the involved aircraft. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

It acheives this by transmitting radio waves vertically downwards from an aerial on the underside of the fuselage which are then reflected back from the ground and received via a separate aerial. The height of the aircraft is proprotional to the time taken for the radio waves to be received after being transmitted. In most Commercial Air Transport (CAT) aircraft the radio altimeter is operational up to 2500 ft above ground level (AGL) The radio altitude display will disappear from the PFD when above 2500 ft. As well as displaying height to the pilots the output from the radio altimeter is used by other systems including TCAS, GPWS/TAWS and the Autopilot. Autopilots need very accurate height information to perform an automatic landing as the flare manoeuvre is based on the height of the lowest wheels of the landing gear above the runway. For this reason a radio altimeter has to be calibrated so that it reads 0 ft when, in the landing configuration, the wheels touch the runway. The height between the fuselage aerials and the lowest wheel of the landing gear, in the landing configuration, is known as the Residual Height and will be different for each aircraft type. Note: The ‘landing configuration’ is with the landing gear oleos fully extended and the aircraft in a nose high approach attitude. After landing with the oleos compressed and the fuselage level the residual distance will be less so the radio altimeter may indicate a small minus figure.",

Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) (figure 1) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Seven main conditions give rise to audible and visual alerts.

The stall warning will typically consist of an aural warning with a voice warning such as ‘STALL, STALL’, and a stick shaker connected to the control column. Caution! The stall warning is only alerting the pilot that the aircraft has entered a stall while the stick pusher is a protection – it acts on the control column to prevent the aircraft from entering the stall conditions. With regards to this question, if no warning is heard upon recognition of the stalling conditions, it means that the stall warning is inoperative. However, if the stick pusher activated in timely and appropriate manner, it means that the stall PROTECTION system was working correctly.",

The vertical speeds to be avoided are displayed with a red area and the required ones with a green area. The reduction of rate of climb will put the vertical speed needle into the green area.

The vertical distance of the lowest structure on the airframe, which is the extended main gear, from the ground surface is measured by a device called a radio altimeter. Indications given by this device are therefore equal to the aircraft’s true height. Its indication ranges from 0 to 2500 ft and besides visually providing the actual radio altitude, the system also issues aural alerts when passing certain radio heights. In addition to direct display, the radio altitude information is also sent to other systems, such as: flight director and autopilot systems (including Autoland and auto thrust), the GPWS, as well as the airborne or traffic collision avoidance system (ACAS/TCAS). With regards to this question: The GPWS system is active at all heights at which the low range radio altimeter can function, i.e. between ground and 2500 ft AGL. A dangerous situation that could be caused by a false radio height is a mode change in the automatic thrust control. If a radio altimeter erraneously reports a radio height of 50 ft or below while the autothrust system is engages in approach mode, it will trigger the flare or retard step of the autoland sequence and reduce thrust to zero for the flare.",

The system generates a windshear warning whenever the predicted energy level for the aircraft falls below a predetermined threshold. This energy level as an angle of attack and is compared with an angle-of-attack threshold above which windshear conditions are most likely to occur and requiring pilot action. The aural warning consists of a two-tone siren, which is followed by an aural warning of “WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR”. A visual warning message is also displayed on each Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI), and remains there until the windshear condition subsides. The windshear warnings also take priority over all other GPWS modes, and only become active on take-off after rotation.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ Radio Altitude and automatically selects the correct mode of operation. Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Seven main conditions give rise to audible and visual alerts. These conditions are described as MODES: - MODE 1 - Excessive Barometric Descent Rate - MODE 2 - Excessive Terrain Closure Rate - MODE 3 - Altitude Loss after Take-off or Go-around - MODE 4A - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Landing Gear Not down This mode activates whenever the terrain clearance reduces to 500 ft radio altitude, regardless of the barometric rate, UNLESS the landing gear is fully extended. AURAL ALERT -”TOO LOW GEAR” or “TOO LOW TERRAIN” - MODE 4B - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Flaps Not in Landing Configuration This mode provides an alert when the gear is down and the flaps are not in the landing position. The standard upper boundary for this sub mode is 245 ft radio altitude. AURAL ALERT - ”TOO LOW FLAPS” or “TOO LOW TERRAIN” - MODE 5 - Below Glide Slope Deviation Alert- MODE 6A - Below Selected Minimum Radio Altitude - MODE 6B Altitude Call-outs and Bank Angle Alert - MODE 7 Windshear Alerting",

If your aircraft and the intruder both have Mode S data link transponders the system will co-ordinate the RAs to provide complementary vertical avoidance instructions. INFORMATION DISPLAY The action required to comply with the Resolution Advisory displays on a specialised Resolution Advisory/Vertical Speed Indicator (RA /VSI) instrument using a colour liquid crystal screen, which shows the rate of climb, and intruder information. On other aeroplanes, the intruder information displays on the EFIS Navigation Display screen. In either case, the symbology used is the same: Hollow White or blue diamond - Other traffic not offering a threat. Solid White of blue diamond - Traffic within 6 nm and 1200 ft vertically. Solid Yellow Circle - Traffic advisory. Solid Red Square - Resolution advisory. Each symbol has a data tag attached to it, which appears in the same colour as the associated symbols. This data provides the altitude of the target in reference to your own aeroplane’s altitude (e.g. + 06 indicates 600 ft above). An arrow also indicates whether the ‘target’ is climbing or descending. There is also often provision to display momentarily absolute pressure altitude in hundreds of feet of pressure altitude. Where the target is a mode A transponder with no height transmissions, no data tag appears and no RA is given. If the target does not have a functioning transponder, the TCAS system is unable to detect its presence.",

They are the next highest priority alert messages after warning messages, and they are usually amber. Warning message – immediate recognition and corrective or compensatory action by the crew IS required. They are the highest priority alert messages and always of red colour on the displays. Warning messages are triggered for situations such as the VMO/MMO exceedance or stall warning. Aural alerts are used to attract attention via a different sensory input. All warnings and most cautions are provided with aural alerts (fire bell, autopilot/autothrottle disconnect wail, stall warner, GPWS, etc.). They serve a different purpose to visual indications, and can be used alongside for increased attention. Haptic and tactile alerts (such as the stick shaker) can also be used to alert the pilot further, and can allow the pilot to make sense of the inputs faster and perform associated procedures better. Note: The only possible answer here includes aural alerts, but for a caution, this is not always strictly the case, such as the B737 master caution (which has no aural alert), but the question is arguably still correct, as this light indication alone might not cause the pilot to look up at all from their paperwork (the master caution light is difficult to miss with normal head positioning whilst looking forwards.). This is still the most correct answer by far over the other options.",

            "explanation": "The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square. A TCAS II provides the intruder relative position (Traffic advisory and proximate traffic) and possibly an indication of a collision avoidance maneuver (Resolution Advisory) within the vertical plane only, by comparing the mode C pressure altitudes of the aircraft. The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay.",

The vertical distance of the lowest structure on the airframe, which is the extended main gear, from the ground surface is measured by a device called a radio altimeter. Indications given by this device are therefore equal to the aircraft’s true height. Its indication ranges from 0 to 2500 ft and besides visually providing the actual radio altitude, the system also issues aural alerts when passing certain radio heights. In addition to direct display, the radio altitude information is also sent to other systems, such as: flight director and autopilot systems (including Autoland and auto thrust), the GPWS, as well as the airborne or traffic collision avoidance system (ACAS/TCAS). With regards to this question: The GPWS system is active at all heights at which the low range radio altimeter can function, i.e. between ground and 2500 ft AGL. A dangerous situation that could be caused by a false radio height is a mode change in the automatic thrust control. If a radio altimeter erraneously reports a radio height of 50 ft or below while the autothrust system is engages in approach mode, it will trigger the flare or retard step of the autoland sequence and reduce thrust to zero for the flare. We believe that the option \"TCAS\" should not be within the available options as an isolated item - it should be included in the correct option as it is also affected by a radio altimeter malfunction/failure.",

This system provides advisory and traffic displays of the other airplanes to the flight crew. Neither advisory, guidance, nor traffic display is provided for other airplanes which do not have operating transponders. TCAS equipment interrogates the transponders of other airplanes to determine their range, bearing, and altitude. A traffic advisory (TA) is generated when the other airplane is approximately 40 seconds from the point of closest approach. If the other airplane continues to close, a resolution advisory (RA) is generated when the other airplane is approximately 25 seconds from the point of closest approach. The RA provides aural warning and guidance as well as maneuver guidance to maintain or increase separation from the traffic. If altitude data from the traffic aircraft’s transponder is not available, no RA can be provided. The TCAS also has feeds from the radio altimeter to modify the RAs received when in close proximity to the ground. There are no instructions given at all when the aircraft is below 400 ft AGL, no descent RAs are given below 1000 ft AGL and no increase rate of descent commands below 1450 ft AGL. Below 1,000 feet when the TA/RA mode is selected on the transponder panel, TA only mode is enabled automatically and the TCAS message TA ONLY displays on the ND. The system will also take aircraft configuration/performance into consideration when deciding an avoiding action. When the aircraft has gear and/or flap deployed its climb performance will be poor so TCAS will avoid giving climbing demands for an RA.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

TCAS II uses a Mode S transponder, the same transponder that's interrogated by air traffic control (ATC) to provide the aircrafts altitude, identity and other flight information. The normal operational range of TCAS II is 14 nm and it can detect up to 30 aircraft. In high density traffic areas the ATC transponder functions need to be protected. This is achieved by limiting the amount of time the transponder spends on TCAS functions to approximately 2%. When multiple intruder aircraft are detected TCAS II enters a 'reduced surveillance' mode by extending the interrogation rate from 1 second to 5 seconds and reducing the range to 5nm to prioritise the nearest threats.",

If you do see a question about only GPWS, please go to question 222062 and let us know in the comments, we want to check if it is being asked alongside this one, thanks! GPWS The aim of the GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System) is to give visual and audible warning signals to a pilot when the aircraft’s proximity to the terrain poses a potential threat to its safety. GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ Radio Altitude and automatically selects the correct mode of operation, using the radio altimeter and other inputs to automatically select the correct mode of operation, delivering one of many different aural alerts (made up of aural cautions [yellow], and aural warnings [red], depending on the mode and distance from terrain/impact) to the flight crew, such as \"SINK RATE\" when the rate of descent is too high, or \"GLIDESLOPE\", when the aircraft deviates too far below the glideslope. EGPWS is called enhanced GPWS, and is the much more modern version of the older GPWS system. It uses a terrain database to \"look ahead\" at the aircraft's flight path and call out if it is on track to hit terrain. This is something that the older GPWS system could only guess at, as it could only measure the distance from terrain directly below the aircraft. This means that as well as the standard GPWS alerts and warnings, EGPWS can give the pilots a view of the nearby terrain on their navigation display (ND) to aid situational awareness and their subsequent terrain escape manoeuvre.",

The GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. However, this limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Given the location of the aircraft, its course and height (either from the ADC or derived from GPS) a display can be created showing the locations of terrain that could threaten the safety of the aircraft. Note: It is important to note that the EGPWS has the basic functions of the GPWS to which the 'look ahead' function is added. This means that the EGPWS also relies on the Radio Altimeter as one of its inputs.

The second statement refers to the Stall Warning device usually found on small aircraft. Light aircraft normally have an audible stall-warning device that operates just before the stall. This device is activated by a moving vane (Flapper Switch), positioned approximately midway along the wing, just below the leading edge as seen in figure 2. Airflow holds down the vane at normal operating angles of attack, but just before the wing stalls, movement of the stagnation point around the leading edge lifts the vane (figure 3). This closes a micro-switch and sounds a buzzer in the cockpit, giving warning of an impending stall.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000° M or 360° M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least The relationship between the different directions can be expressed by the following table: True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 356° 5°W 001° 1°W 002° Note: The TVMDC table can be used to relate both Heading directions or track directions.",

You’re currently maintaining a compass heading of 242°, therefore you look for this value in the lower line of the deviation table. The value above 242°, in the ‘to fly’ line is 240°. This means that while maintaining a compass indication of 242°, you are flying in reality on a magnetic heading of 240°. Our acronym becomes now as follows: 242° - D – 240° - 22°E - T You don’t really need to find the deviation because you already have the magnetic heading and the variation. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily find the true heading of the aircraft. Moving from the left to the right of the acronym, you need to add if the variation is East (CADET = AD (add) E (east)). In our case, the variation is East, therefore you need to add the 22°E variation to the magnetic heading to obtain a True heading of 262°. It is not needed, nor asked in this question to find the deviation. But you can do it anyway to exercise the two acronyms and get better at solving this type of question. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily deduce that the variation is 2°W. In fact, in the direction from C (compass) to T (true) you need to add the deviation whenever it is E (east). In our case we initially have a value of 242° and moving to the right of the acronym (towards T=true), you obtain a value of 240° magnetic heading - the difference hasn’t been added but subtracted. Therefore, the deviation is West.",

For example if your heading is 180 degrees and you start turning left your heading indication will decrease through 170, 160, 150 etc. Therefore, it is normal for a left turn to show a decreasing heading value on the DRMC. The DRMC, although simple and prone to errors, is fitted to all aircraft and commonly used as a standby instrument. It’s therefore very important that its indications are checked before you get airborne. The best way to do this is to check its indications with a known value such as the runway heading or another navigation system. The question states that the DRMC indicates 20 degrees differently from the runway heading. Easy Access Rules for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25) states that the DRMC is allowed a maximum error of 10 degrees in normal level flight! Therefore, even allowing for the fact that RW27 could have a magnetic Hdg of 275, the DRMC is unserviceable",

This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card.

HORIZONTAL COMPONENT The horizontal component (H) of the earth’s field is known as the directive force and it is the component which aligns the magnetic compass needle with the magnetic meridian (providing a directional reference). Near the magnetic poles, the vertical component becomes much greater than at lower latitudes where the horizontal component dominates. This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the South - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the South.",

At some point, when the bank angle gets too big, the compass will just ‘fall’ and rotate 180° towards the lowest wing which is into the turn, and the compass will indicate West instead of East. Therefore, the total error of the compass would be 180° on an easterly heading in a steep right turn. Conclusion: beyond the critical bank angle (90 minus the dip angle), the compass will lag by 180 degrees when the aircraft is banked towards the equator.

The earth's magnetic field has two components or forces: a horizontal force parallel to the earth's surface that is used to align the compass with magnetic north and therefore to determine direction and a vertical force that causes the needle to dip down. At the magnetic equator, the horizontal force is dominant, and therefore, there is no dip and the compass is accurate. However, as you move closer to either of the magnetic poles, the vertical component increases, and this induces the magnetic bar in the compass to dip down to align itself vertically with the magnetic field. Lines joining points of equal dip are called isoclinic lines, or magnetic latitudes. There is a magnetic latitude roughly near the equator where the dip is zero (referred to as aclinic line).",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another thing to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

The compass’ needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles.

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration or deceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. The Artificial Horizon experiences the following errors: 1. Turning errors 2. Acceleration errors 3. Real wander of the gyroscope's spin axis away from its alignment with the earth vertical. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating, the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. When the aircraft is decelerating, the result is a false pitch down and left-hand turn indication.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

            "explanation": "When accelerating in level flight, you would expect the artificial horizon (AH) to show wings level and a steady nose attitude. However, due to its construction, both the electrical and air driven AH will show a false attitude. This is because the force of acceleration affects their erection systems. The electrical AH will show a false climb. The air driven AH will show a false climb and a right turn. This question appears to be asking about an air driven version. The air-driven artificial horizon gives the pilot the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon and is part of the essential set of instruments in any aircraft. It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement. Note: Both AH show a false nose up when accelerating, as seen in many other questions. The 2021 Learning Objectives focus more on the effect of acceleration, rather than the cause. That said, the electrical AH uses mercury switches to maintain the gyro axis vertical. In normal operation, the mercury sits at the bottom of the switch and the circuit is open. During an acceleration, the mercury is pushed out of position and closes the switch, ultimately driving the gyro to show a false climb. An air driven AH uses a pendulous unit and vanes to maintain the gyro axis vertical. During an acceleration, the force acts to disturb both the pendulous unit and the vanes, and this results in a false right climb indication.",

If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn.

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The main direction indication of the system comes from a directional gyroscope, which is kept from drifting by tying it to the output of a flux valve unit for magnetic reference. This happens when “slave” is selected on the “free/slave” switch. Alternative Explanation: The Gyro-Magnetic Compass (GMC) system has two operational modes: \"SLAVE\" mode: used when magnetic heading references are reliable. It is the normal magnetically-monitored mode. In this mode, the directional gyro is connected to the magnetic flux detector, which provides a stable magnetic reference to counteract the gyro's apparent drift. \"FREE\" mode (Directional gyro): used when magnetic heading references are not reliable, such as in polar regions. In this mode, the system supplies an inertial heading reference, and the pilot manually introduces corrections to compensate for earth rate and other errors. If the switch is changed to \"FREE\" the magnetic signal from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/stator comparison stops, and the gyro is no longer tied to azimuth, and thus acts as a free gyro (DGI). Note: Please read the question carefully as there are two similar questions in our database. One question pertains to FREE mode, while the other one pertains to SLAVE mode.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro.

It has only one gimbal, providing the turn indicator’s rate gyro only one degree of freedom. This freedom is limited by a restraining spring by connecting the gimbal to the outer case of the instrument. A reverse gearing system transmits the movement of the gimbal to a pointer which indicates the rate of turn over a rate of turn calibrated scale. The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft. The gimbal is calibrated for a certain range of airspeeds only and is prevented to get damaged at high rate turns by a dampening system.

Wander may be either real or apparent (the difference is explained below) or a combination of both. Wander is subdivided into drift and topple.

If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn.

Gravity erection is essential for the operation of an artificial horizon. However, accelerations occur during flight which cannot be distinguished from gravitational accelerations, induce indication errors. The erection system therefore tries to align the gyro axis with the apparent vertical. During acceleration, the erection system is unable to distinguish between acceleration caused by gravity (in the direction of the local vertical) and the inertia of its sensor. As a result, the apparent vertical is inclined to the rear (spin axis is displaced from the vertical) and causes a higher pitch indication. In simple words, the horizon bar moves down, indicating a climb. Deceleration causes the apparent vertical to tilt forwards, reducing the perceived pitch attitude.",

            "explanation": "Rigidity in space and precession are two main properties of a gyroscope. These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

            "explanation": "The artificial horizon gives the pilot an indication of the aircraft’s attitude in pitch and roll. It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes. Additionally, some more sophisticated artificial horizons are electrically driven and maintain the rotor’s axis vertical by using two mercury level switches and two torque motors.",

This implies that the angle of bank should be correct for the TAS and rate of turn. The slip indicator gives a direct indication of the state of balance of the turn. This comprises a solid ball in a curved tube containing liquid with damps out the unwanted oscillations. The heavy ball behaves like a pendulum, with the centre of curvature of the tube acting as the effective point of suspension. Operating Principles Consider first the aircraft in level flight with lift L balancing weight W (figure 1). The weight W of the ball in the tube acts downwards and is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite reaction of the base of the tube on the ball, acting upwards towards the centre of curvature of the tube. If the wings are level, the ball will lie just between the two vertical lines etched on the tube. Now let us consider a balanced turn to the left (figure 2). The aircraft with lift L equal and opposite to the resultant of aircraft weight W and centrifugal force C, the latter being proportional to TAS and rate of turn. The ball is also subject to a centrifugal force depending on TAS and rate of turn, so it rolls outwards, taking up a new equilibrium position such that the reaction of the base of the tube on the ball is again exactly balanced, this time by the resultant of ball weight W and centrifugal force C.",

APPARENT WANDER In this type of wander, the gyro spin axis does not physically wander away from its pre-set direction, but to an observer it appears to have changed its direction. This is because the gyro maintains its direction with respect to a fixed point in space, whereas the observer rotates with the Earth, thus with the passage of time the gyro appears to have changed direction, with reference to an Earth datum. Apparent wander, is also made up of horizontal components called drift, and vertical components called topple. The rate of drift and topple depends upon the latitude and can vary from zero to a maximum of 15.04° per hour (the rate at which the Earth rotates).",

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

If the switch is changed to \"FREE,\" the magnetic signal from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/stator comparison stops, and the gyro is no longer tied to azimuth, and thus acts as a free gyro (DGI). Note: Please read the question carefully as there are two similar questions in our database. One question pertains to FREE mode, while the other one pertains to SLAVE mode.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This is the exact setup of a turn indicator. Gyro B – The spin axis is vertical (yaw axis), and the gyro can move about the pitch axis.

It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating, for example, during a take-off run, the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement.",

TAS exhibits an inverse relationship with the rate of turn, but it is directly proportional to the radius of the turn due to the increase in inertia and momentum of the aircraft with an increase in TAS. You can quickly compute the necessary bank angle for a standard 3° per second turn using the formula: Angle of bank = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7 For instance, for TAS values of 100 knots and 150 knots: Angle of bank for 100 knots = (100 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 17° Angle of bank for 150 knots = (150 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 22° This comparison reveals that as speed increases, so does the required bank angle to maintain the standard rate of turn, indicating a proportional relationship with TAS.",

The control system of the air driven artificial horizon consists of four slots and four pendulous vanes at the base of the rotor housing, so that when the rotor axis is vertical each slot is half covered by its vane. Because the four jets are of equal strength but in opposite directions no force is exerted on the gyro and therefore no precession occurs - the gyro rotor remaining vertical. The opposing vanes are fixed to a common spindle so that the four vanes operate as two pairs. The positioning of the vanes is such that if the rotor axis wanders from the vertical, one vane will hang clear of its slot, allowing unrestricted airflow, while the opposite slot is completely obstructed by its vane. The resulting unbalanced airflow precesses the gyro and corrects the tilt, returning the gyro axis to the vertical. ACCELERATION ERROR (figure 2) The control system of the air driven artificial horizon depends on the pendulous vanes being affected by the earth’s gravity. However, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. When an aircraft accelerates in a level attitude (such as during the take-off run) a false nose- up, right wing down, or climbing right hand turn indication will result. During acceleration, the lateral vanes lag, swinging back towards the pilot, opening the starboard slot and closing the port slot. This results in a reaction which acts to port. By the rule of precession the effect on the gyro is as if the direction of application of the Reaction had been moved 90° in the direction of rotor spin (anticlockwise). The gyro will now be precessed out of vertical with the base moving backwards towards the pilot. This movement is transmitted via the guide pin and horizon bar arm to bring the horizon bar below the gull-wing giving a nose-up indication. Due to inertia, the weighted base of the rotor housing tries to lag during acceleration. This force will be precessed, resulting in the base of the rotor housing moving to starboard and the gyro axis precessing out of the vertical. This rotates the whole rotor / gimbal assembly about the longitudinal axis to give a right wing down indication.",

Gyroscope - A gyroscope provides an AHRS with a measurement of the aircraft's angular rate. Each angular rate is integrated to determine the aircraft's attitude. Accelerometer - An accelerometer supplies an AHRS with a measure of the aircraft's acceleration and is assumed to be measuring gravity alone. This assumption allows the accelerometer to calculate the pitch and roll angles from the direction of the gravity vector. Magnetometer - Since the accelerometer can only measure pitch & roll, a magnetometer provides an AHRS with a measurement of yaw by comparing the measurement of the magnetic field surrounding the aircraft to Earth's magnetic field, just like a traditional magnetic compass.",

INSs can be considered to be stand-alone, whereas IRSs are integrated with the FMS. The wording of these options seems to be almost intentionally difficult to understand. To start, we need to realise that EASA are referring to a stabilised platform INS when they call something an inertial navigation system, as per the above learning objective. These are systems that, once aligned, have a platform that remains level and pointing towards the North, which is controlled by rate-integrating gyros and servo motors to keep the platform in that orientation. By inputting the initial location when the INS is aligned and kept still, the system can then track every acceleration in the North/South and East/West axis to keep a track of speed and therefore distance travelled along those axes. Therefore, there is still a reference for this system, the North direction and which way is up. The platform then endeavours to maintain these references during flight. More modern systems using the same idea are called strapdown IRSs. They are much smaller and cheaper, and are fixed to the aircraft structure, measuring the accelerations and rotations of the aircraft and applying them in a computer model of the Earth to provide an improved version of an INS.",

Moreover, by detecting the drift due to the earth’s rotation, the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) will be able to internally calculate the True North. Latitude can also be internally calculated, but because this calculation is not sufficiently precise, a manual position input is required from the flight crew for this alignment sequence. Therefore, the system will compare the inserted latitude with the calculated one and compute precisely the aircraft’s position. On the other hand, the IRS cannot calculate/measure longitude, therefore the only reference is the one provided by the pilot during the alignment process.",

Accelerations in the East/West and North/South directions are measured by the accelerometers and are integrated. Acceleration integrated over time: Once = change in velocity. Twice = change in position. It is also true if we state that integrating velocity once over time gives the change in position. Internally, this is calculated by integrators that are time multiplication devices. Initially, acceleration is supplied to the integrator as a value in ft/sec². Multiplying a value in ft/sec² by another value in sec will give you a result in ft/sec => velocity. Velocity is basically how fast has the aircraft moved in feet per second. Then, this value is sent to another integrator to derive the change in position and determine the current position of the aircraft. In other words, a value in ft/sec is multiplied again by a value in seconds, which will result in a value in feet or NM => distance. The second integration will provide the IRS with the distance traveled, but if the initial position AND speed are known as well, the IRS will output the instantaneous position. Summary table of the integration process of the INS and the required inputs: Integrate with time. How many times?

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

When stationary the only output from the accelerometers will be due to gravity. During alignment the platform is driven by torque motors until no acceleration is sensed and is therefore level. Once level the platform has to be 'gyrocompassed' to align it with True North. This is acheived by monitoring the output of the gyros to sense topple caused by Earth rotation, the time taken to do this increases with latitude. For these reasons alignment can only be acheived if the aircraft is stationary. Moving an aircraft during alignment will require the process to start again when stationary and it could take as long as 15 - 20 minutes before alignment is complete. Pilots should always wait until INS alignment is complete before moving the aircraft",

The question is asking how these unbounded errors are affecting the system over time since they are the only cumulative errors. In fact, they increase proportionally with time, which means that the error increases as ‘t’ increases. Bounded errors are usually the following: Initial misalignment may not be conducted 100% correctly (aircraft shaking due to ground equipment positioning, crew activity, etc.) There can always be some errors due to the initial misalignment. Accelerators are mechanical systems consisting of a pendulous mechanism, pickoffs and servos that suffer all from the standard instrument error (manufacturing imperfections). Integrators make errors in the first stage of integration due to the incorrect inputs provided (listed in the points above). Unbounded errors are usually the following: Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. Drift of the gyroscopes of the platform, which are the main source of error.",

This system is composed of a stable platform consisting of high quality gyros and accelerometers and a computer. The purpose of the computer is to integrate the accelerometer outputs with time to give velocity and then integrate velocity with time to give distance travelled. From this is available pitch and roll attitude, true heading, true track, drift, present position in latitude and longitude, ground speed and wind. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. These acceleration measuring devices sense any change in the aircraft’s velocity either as an acceleration or deceleration very accurately. The acceleration signal from the amplifier is sent to an integrator which is a time multiplication device. It starts out with acceleration which is in feet per second squared. In the integrator, it is multiplied by time and the result is a velocity in feet per second. With an input of feet per second, it is then sent through a second integrator, which is multiplied by time, the result is a distance in feet or nautical miles. The computer associated with the inertial system knows the latitude and longitude of the take-off point and calculates that the aircraft has travelled so far in the north and east direction. The computer can then compute the new position of the aircraft and give a digital read-out.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes. Input data is also required, such as the: TAS - to calculate the wind speed/direction. Initial position – because actual aircraft position during the flight is calculated based on the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – the platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. GNSS (GPS) Position - in order to bound the INS position error. Other inptus are: Mach Number, Radio height, Number of satellites and Angle of attack. Note: The correct option was selected according to EASA LO 022.05.01.01.02 which states 'State that inertial systems require no external input, except TAS, to determine aircraft attitude and navigational data.'

The main difference between the two systems is that an IRS uses solid-state sensors, such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes, instead of traditional mechanical gyroscopes and accelerometers. Some of the main advantages of the more modern IRS are: - The solid-state sensors are more reliable and require less maintenance compared to mechanical gyroscopes. They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation. -It consists of three RLGs that measure angular rates and three internal accelerometers measuring acceleration on all three aircraft’s body axes (longitudinal, lateral, and normal). The laser gyros allow a microprocessor to maintain a stable platform mathematically, rather than mechanically. - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data. For example, errors caused by temperature changes, sensor drift, or other external factors.",

The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Instead, the system uses ring laser gyros (RLGs) that are attached to the aircraft structure in a specific orientation, and are therefore referred to as strapped-down. The coordinate system for computations is composed of the 3 aircraft axes. The IRS uses 3 accelerometers and 3 RLGs that are installed at right angles to one another to measure linear accelerations and rotations around the aircraft axes. A high-performance computer creates a virtual stabilised platform that is kept aligned by using information from the gyros. Note that there is no physical platform that is kept aligned/level. In flight, the aircraft moves around the centre of gravity (CG). Placing the IRS unit close to the CG improves the reliability of the readings and reduces the amount of IRS drift experienced. RLGs produce two, constant, high-frequency beams of light that travel over a system of mirrors/through fibreoptics, in opposite directions. When the RLG is at rest, the signal from both beams is identical. When a RLG is rotated about its sensitive axis, both beams are affected by the Doppler effect. One is red shifted, and the other blue shifted. This causes a phase difference which can be interpreted by the computer to map motion. \"The IRS is located a bit away from the aircraft CG and it uses laser gyros to calculate accelerations.\" INCORRECT. The laser gyros do not detect accelerations - accelerometers do that job. Furthermore, as stated above, it is located close to the CG of the aircraft. \"It consists of gyros and accelerometers. The gyros keep the platform level and the accelerometers calculate acceleration.\" INCORRECT. The older stable-platform INS uses gyros and accelerometers on a level platform. \"The IRS is most reliable using lower frequency laser beams.\" INCORRECT. Laser gyros use a high frequency excitation of the laser gas, not low frequency.",

The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. LEVELLING AND ALIGNMENT For a conventional gyro system, the process of levelling and alignment takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It is important that the aeroplane does not move during this process, because the resultant accelerations upset the system, preventing the platform from aligning. This process also requires corrections to be applied, which are dependent on the system being ‘told’ the accurate value of the present latitude and longitude. The alignment process is unsuccessful if the wrong latitude is initially entered into the system; if the error is small, it leads to poor alignment and degraded accuracy. If the latitude error is large, the platform is unable to align. If the longitude is however wrongly inserted during the initialisation process, it does not adversely affect the alignment process, but will affect the accuracy of any subsequent position. This is because the INS is a direct reading system, and if you start with a wrong position all subsequent positions are wrong.",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

The main difference between the two systems is that an IRS uses solid-state sensors, such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes, instead of traditional mechanical gyroscopes and accelerometers. Some of the main advantages of the more modern IRS are: - The solid-state sensors are more reliable and require less maintenance compared to mechanical gyroscopes. They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data. For example, errors caused by temperature changes, sensor drift, or other external factors. While traditional INS systems using mechanical gyroscopes and stand-alone computers are still in use in many aircraft today, IRS systems offer several advantages over their predecessors, including higher accuracy, faster response times, and better reliability.",

It is used for the aircraft inertial navigation systems and attitude/heading reference systems. It is a very accurate system to measure rotation about a given axis and is widespread in modern commercial aircraft IRS systems. Conventional gyro’s rotation mass is replaced by two contra-rotating beams of light. The case of the RLG is made of a vitreous ceramic material of low-temperature coefficient. Two gas-tight openings are carefully designed into the single-piece case of the RLG, which are then filled with inert gas, such as a mixture of Helium and Neon. A direct current electrical discharge ionizes the gas and creates two beams of light flowing in opposite directions in the two cavities of the RLG case. In order to produce a continuous laser circuit in the enclosed area of the RLG’s case, a set of mirrors is installed to reflect and trap the laser beams. The frequency of oscillation of each beam depends on the optical path length and corresponds to the cavity resonance condition. When the RLG is stationary, both optical path lengths of each beam are identical. However, when the RLG is rotated about the axis perpendicular to the laser beams plane, one beam will travel a larger distance, and the other will cover a shorter distance. The frequency difference induced by different path lengths is proportional to the rotation rate.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Most aircraft of any size will be fitted with at least two inertial systems. The duplication is for redundancy and so that the information can be compared for possible error. The starting point for an inertial navigation system is acceleration. If acceleration is known, then the aircraft's speed can be calculated. If the speed is known, the distance travelled can be calculated. To solve a complete navigation problem in space, we need to know the acceleration in three axes at right angles to each other. The inertial system relates its acceleration to the three axes and recognizes the direction, using three methods: Stable Platform or Stabilised Inertial Platform Wander Angle Strapdown The Stable Platform, which keeps the platform, on which the accelerometers are mounted, always level and aligned to North, and also measures acceleration relative to the platform. Alignment and levelling is done only once for each flight with the aircraft stationary on the ground. Once aligned, the inertial system is not and cannot be re-aligned for the remainder of the flight. Attitude data is still valid, and will continue to drive servo attitude and heading instruments or EFIS indications.",

The ADC collects relevant air data, automatically eliminates the position errors of its individual sensors, computes the required output parameters and provides them to as many systems as desired. Some air data can be displayed without further computations. These are the TAT, altitude and IAS. Because systems errors are internally corrected, IAS is equal to CAS. The centralised processing of air data parameters allows for the computation of additional outputs, which could not be obtained from separate instruments. TAT can be converted to the actual outside air temperature (OAT) considering the flight Mach number. Once OAT has been determined, it can be used to obtain TAS from the corrected values for static and total pressure (which is CAS).

For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. The quality of information is dependent on the accuracy of the initial (input) data, and the precision with which the system aligns to True North. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. To keep the reference valid, the accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Rate integrating gyros are for use as sensors to detect any departure of the platform from its level and desired alignment. BOUNDED ERRORS These errors build up to a maximum positive and negative values, and return to zero within each 84.4 minutes Schuler cycle and thus averages out over the period. The main causes of these errors are: - platform tilt, due to initial misalignment - inaccurate measurement of acceleration by accelerometers - integrator errors in the first integration stage UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE TRACK ERRORS These errors arise from the misalignment of the accelerometers in the horizontal plane, and the main causes of these errors are: - Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. - Wander of the azimuth gyro. UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE DISTANCE ERROR These errors give rise to cumulative errors in the recording of the total distance travelled. The main causes of this error are: - Wander in the levelling gyros. - Integrator errors in the second stage of integration. INHERENT ERRORS The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. Such errors vary from system to system, depending upon the balance achieved between accuracy on one hand and the simplicity of design, reliability, ease of construction and cost of production on the other.",

Inertial Reference Systems (IRS) or Inertial Reference Units (IRU) are navigation systems used in aircraft that use gyroscopes and accelerometers to calculate the aircraft's position, velocity, and attitude. The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. By entering the initial position and recording the IRU operation hours, the flight crew can compare the calculated position at the end of the flight with the actual position to determine the drift. RADIAL ERROR This error provides an indication of the continuing serviceability of the INS, and is derived from the following: Radial Error = Distance of final ramp position from INS position / Elapsed time in hours, expressed in (NM/hour) When calculating the distance between two positions, consider the latitude. It is also good practice to monitor the performance of the INS at the end of each flight. Comparing the INS display with the ramp position does this, where the radial error is established using Pythagoras, which when divided by the recorded time in the navigation mode, gives the average error.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an Inertial Reference System (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Initial position – because actual aircraft position at any point during the flight, is calculated from the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – to stabilize the vertical navigation, thus stabilizing vertical velocity and inertial altitude information. The platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. The initial alignment and leveling of the IRS need to be carried out when the aircraft is stationary and on the ground. A set of three accelerometers will sense gravitational acceleration that will derive the local vertical of the platform. Once the vertical is found thanks to the gravity, any change of attitude in space will be detected, but they will only come from the Earth’s rotation (on the ground when stationary). Moreover, by detecting the drift due to the earth’s rotation, the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) will be able to internally calculate the True North. Latitude can also be internally calculated, but because this calculation is not sufficiently precise, a manual position input is required from the flight crew for this alignment sequence. Therefore, the system will compare the inserted latitude with the calculated one and compute precisely the aircraft’s position. On the other hand, the IRS cannot calculate/measure longitude, therefore the only reference is the one provided by the pilot during the alignment process.",

If you do have any further exam feedback, please let us know in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Inertial Navigation Systems are devices which allow us to have a self contained method of navigating, via just the accelerations of the aircraft. The basic principle is that, if an INS knows the initial location of the aircraft, and knows that it is completely still at that time (during initialisation), then it can precisely measure the aircraft's turns and accelerations to calculate its current position. It uses the mathematical process of integration to first work out the aircraft's velocity and direction, then integrates again to find the change in distance, which it then adds/removes from the original location. The oldest INSs use a \"stable platform\" design, which is a large platform that is kept pointing towards True North and perfectly upright, no matter the aircraft's heading or attitude. It manages this by using 3 rate-integrating gyros to measure the aircraft's turns around all three axes, and counter them by moving the platform the other way. It can then use 2 accelerometers to calculate the North-South acceleration, and the East-West accelerations, which are fed into a mechanical computer (a complex set of cogs and gears) that provide an output of speed and position, and other useful metrics. More modern aircraft use Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs), which are a form of INS, but are connected directly to the aircraft (no stable platform). These are much lighter, and less complex to have on board, as they use a set of 3 ring laser gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers to measure all the rotations and accelerations, and then calculates into their various components (North-South, East-West and Vertical) using modern computer methods. This is called a strapdown system, as it is fixed to the aircraft, and is much more usable with other systems, as it can feed info to the FMS, etc. This question is not very well worded, as the question is asking about inertial navigation systems, but the most correct answer (and the answer from feedback) is actually more related to IRSs. To clarify, we can go through each option: \"true airspeed (TAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" This is quite blatantly wrong, airspeed is measured in one axis by the pitot tubes. \"indicated Airspeed (IAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" Same as above, still wrong. \"acceleration along the aircraft's pitch, roll and yaw axes.\" This one is nearly correct, as it does sense accelerations, but not necessarily along these axes (and these axes refer to rotations). INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions (and maybe vertically). \"acceleration along the north-south, east-west and vertical axes.\" This is most correct, but only just. As mentioned above, INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions. They can sense vertical accelerations also, if they have a third accelerometer, but this is not so well documented in the learning objectives, and is more to do with IRSs, which all measure vertical acceleration as part of their normal process. This is why this question can garner some opposing views, depending on interpretation. So far, this is our best option.",

The commands from the Flight Director computer are also modelled so that any command given will not unduly over stress the airframe. For example, in Heading Mode the Flight Directors will indicate a fly to command to bring the aircraft on to the desired heading. Movement of the roll command bar to the left or right requires rolling the aeroplane to the left or right, in order to centre the command bar, and to satisfy the computed command. When centred, the command bar indicates the achievement of the required pitch attitude. By virtue of the fact that the command bar deflections are the resultant of a combination of system inputs, do not regard them as positional to acquire a required state. They are simply a command for change in pitch and/or roll attitude, e.g. - Pitch Command Bar UP - Pitch Up - Roll Command Bar RIGHT - Roll Right Pitch Command Bar UP - Pitch Up",

This means ensuring the autopilot does not break aircraft limitations in terms of speed, load factor, pitch and bank limits etc. The autopilot should be able to use a satisfactory amount of the performance of the aircraft otherwise the manoeuvres would take too long to execute. Whenever the autopilot is required to make a correction either for stability or when referring to a particular flight path, the control response will always be in proportion to deviation or corrective action required but only up to a limit that prevents the autopilot attempting a manoeuvre that would cause an excursion from the safe flight envelope. Command Speed Limiting The AFS provides speed, pitch and thrust commands to avoid exceeding the following limit speeds: - VMO/MMO. - Wing flap limiting speeds. - Landing gear speeds. - Minimum speed. Reversion Modes During some flight situations, speed control by the AFDS or A/T alone could be insufficient to prevent exceeding a limit speed. If this occurs, AFDS and A/T mode automatically revert to a more effective combination. The reversion modes are: - Placard Limit reversion. - Minimum airspeed reversion. Mode reversion occurs slightly before reaching the limit speed. Flight Envelope Protection Flight envelope protection is installed with the aim of ensuring that the aircraft remains within the normal flight envelope in all phases of flight The system provides protection in all phases of flight to prevent the aircraft exceeding the limits for the following parameters: - Angle of Attack - Speed - Pitch attitude - Bank angle - Loadfactor",

False lobes are due to both the weak sidelobes of the original lobes and the reflection of the lower signals off the ground, creating additional, spurious signals that can confuse the aircraft's receiver. False lobes can cause the aircraft to deviate from the correct glide slope or localizer path, potentially leading to an unsafe condition.",

Autopilot Heading Mode The simplest nav mode is to have the aircraft keep flying in the direction you select, this is called Heading Mode. In this mode the pilot selects a desired heading, either using a knob on the HSI, using the central FDS/autopilot panel or on the MCP. The Flight Director roll bar commands the aeroplane to fly to the Pre- Selected Heading, and subsequently to hold that heading. To achieve this, the computer receives inputs from the attitude reference source, the VG, and the course from the compass system. If the heading source is purely magnetic, the Autopilot will follow the heading regarding this source. If is is incorrect, the autopilot will follow an incorrect heading. Having two flux-valves with combined outputs, is used to reduce errors which otherwise may be present in systems using single pendulously mounted magnetic field responsive devices.",

The Go-around mode is one of the three mixed modes mentioned in the EASA LOs above, with the other two being take-off and approach modes. All three of these modes interact with the autothrottle and autopilot systems to achieve the desired outcomes. When the A/T ARM switch is turned on, the A/T go-around mode becomes active below 2000 feet RA, whether or not the AFDS is engaged. Once activated, the A/T go-around mode remains available for engagement until 2 seconds after touchdown. To engage this mode, you simply press the TOGA switch. When engaged, \"GA\" is displayed for the A/T, and the thrust levers move to the reduced go-around thrust setting, resulting in a climb rate of 1000 to 2000 feet per minute. Pressing the TOGA switch a second time causes the A/T to advance the thrust to the full go-around N1 limit. On Boeing aircraft, this entails pressing TOGA, while on Airbus planes, it involves moving the throttles into the TOGA detent. In either case, the engines power up to full thrust, and the autopilot disengages the approach mode, allowing the aircraft to climb away from the ground. It's important to note that the Go-around mode is not constrained by specific altitudes or heights. Therefore, if the pilot initiates a go-around, the aircraft will climb regardless of whether it is below or above the pre-selected missed approach altitude.",

The Vertical Speed in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). FLIGHT PATH ANGLE The Flight Path Angle is the angle between the Aircraft’s Velocity Vector and the Horizon. If you are flying in a level flight your Flight Path Angle will be zero (over the horizon), regardless of the Pitch Angle. During a descent, the Flight Path Angle will be negative (below the horizon) thus when climbing the Flight Path Angle will be positive (over the horizon). FLIGHT PATH VECTOR The circular symbol represents the aircraft's axis in relation to the vertical and lateral movement referenced to the Earth's surface. If you were stationary on the ground, the circle would be on the horizon line and centred in the display. The data received by the FPV is derived mostly from the Internal Reference System (IRS) of the aircraft; therefore, the Flight Path Vector provides an almost instantaneous display of flight path angle and drift information.",

While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

The AP and FD pitch modes can control a target SPD/MACH or a vertical trajectory, and the A/THR mode can control a fixed thrust or a target SPD/MACH. However, the AP/FD and the A/THR cannot both control a target SPD/MACH simultaneously. Therefore the AP/FD pitch modes and A/THR mode are coordinated as follows: ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a vertical trajectory, the A/THR mode controls the target SPD/MACH. ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a target SPD or MACH, the A/THR mode controls the thrust. ‐ If no AP/FD pitch mode is engaged, the A/THR mode reverts to controlling the SPD/MACH mode. In other words, the selection of an AP/FD pitch mode determines which mode the A/THR controls. The FMGS has guidance parameters for both AP/FD lateral and vertical modes. The AP/FD lateral modes are the same. Two types of autopilot and flight director modes are available to guide the aircraft: ‐ One that steers the aircraft along the lateral, vertical, and speed profiles according to the data the pilot inserts into the MCDU. Flight Management (in the Flight Management and Guidance Computer) computes the corresponding guidance targets. ‐ The other that steers the aircraft according to target values that the pilot selects and the FCU windows display.",

Periodic checks on all ILS equipped runways ensure that the ILS signal quality is at the required level inside a defined envelope. Capturing the ILS glide slope within this envelope ensures that the aircraft is within the area of influence for the primary glide slope. It also ensures that the ILS signal is of sufficient quality to ensure a normal ILS glide slope capture. The ICAO envelope (fig.4) is within: 10 NM from the runway threshold +/-8° laterally from the runway centerline 0.3 x Θ up to 1.75 x Θ (Θ, being the nominal glide path angle). Make sure the aircraft is in the correct ILS envelope. Arming the approach too soon may cause a false Glide Slope interception out of the protected area, making the airplane descend outside the normal glide slope capture zone. Further information: Secondary glide slopes are an inevitable characteristic due to the ILS antenna design. When an aircraft flies well above the main glide slope, the glide slope deviations displayed on the PFD will refer to the nearest glide slope, which may be a secondary glide slope instead of the primary one. This can lead both the flight crew and the autopilot to erroneously consider the secondary glide slope as the reference for the final descent.",

Therefore, besides the autopilot (for obvious reasons) it is the primary source of information during an automatic landing. The transition from one phase to another during the autoland is based on the height measured by the radio altimeter. For example, at 50 ft AGL the glideslope signal is disconnected, and between 50 ft AGL and touch down, the autopilot will keep a vertical speed depending on the radio altimeter height, as this is more precise than the barometric altitude. The higher the VS the sooner the aircraft will start to flare. The auto-thrust is also incorporated in the Autoland system as this provides automatic speed control until touchdown. The pilot will retard the thrust levers at about 10-20 ft (RA) before touchdown.",

As altitude increases and the air gets thinner, the IAS will reduce for a given pitch setting. Consequently, the angle of attack also reduces. As a result, the vertical speed will reduce for a certain pitch attitude. The autopilot will therefore chase the selected vertical speed by pitching up. This results in further decreased IAS.

The sequence of events when a mode is engaged and the different phases are as follows: - initial phase: where attitude is changed to obtain a new trajectory in order to achieve the new parameter; the trajectory will be based on rate of closure which is again based on the difference between the original parameter and the new parameter; - capture phase: where the aircraft will follow a predefined rate of change of trajectory to achieve the new parameter without overshooting/undershooting; - tracking or hold phase: where the aircraft will maintain the set parameter until a new change has been initiated.",

Unfortunately, we haven't been able to obtain this image as of now. When we do acquire it, this question will be updated accordingly. Thank you for your understanding! The primary distinction between the Flight Director System (FDS) and the autopilot lies in their operational roles. The FDS exclusively offers control and guidance instructions to either the pilot or the autopilot, whereas the autopilot physically controls the aircraft's surfaces. The FDS, however, serves as a precise means of cross-verifying the control and guidance commands sent to the autopilot. The FDS can be employed in the following ways: • Flight director mode only: In this scenario, the pilot manually operates the flight controls, adhering to the FDS commands. This typically occurs during the final stages of an approach, particularly for non-automated landings. • Autopilot mode only: Here, the pilot provides sensory guidance to the autopilot via the aircraft's control column/stick. This often happens when pilots are using the autopilot in control wheel steering (CWS) mode. • Flight director and autopilot mode: In this mode, the autopilot adjusts the aircraft's control surfaces in response to the steering commands issued by the FDS. This is common during cruising and most other phases of a commercial transport flight. The modes and control panel are the same for both the Flight Director (FD) and the autopilot. The FD will present on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) the instructions that the autopilot is following to meet the preset parameters.",

Please put any further exam feedback you can remember in the comments or send by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much. Pilot-induced oscillations are where the pilot \"over-controls\" the aircraft, and therefore, will not only correct for an incorrect attitude, altitude, speed, etc., but will over-correct, and go through the equilibrium, ending up in the opposite scenario. This can often be seen on a pilot's first few ILS approaches when they begin to get very accurate near the runway, or during the flare, when pilots sometimes over-flare, and end up porpoising (up and down) along the runway. It is very common in many stages of flight, and something to try and avoid. Autopilots can perform self-induced oscillations too, if they are not quick enough to catch the overcontrolling with their feedback loop, for example. This could be in pitch, or in yaw and roll (which could lead to Dutch roll). This question is very vague, it does not tell us what oscillations we are feeling, nor much about how they have been formed, so we have chosen the most vague answer that is correct (it could also be Dutch roll, but we would have to make a lot more assumptions, so we think that \"Dutch roll\" is not as correct).",

The Fly-By-Wire system has multiple redundancies that offer layered protection: Normal Law offers all the protections (like stall, load factor etc). This is the system in operation during normal flights. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode Flight Mode Flare Mode Alternate Law offers limited protection including stability, load factor and stall protections. Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "ALERT HEIGHT The alert height is evaluated and defined during the aircraft certification. It refers only to autoland operations with fail-operational landing system. The alert height defines the point during an approach with the lowest minima (CAT IIIB): - Before which (above AH) a go-around (or full manual take-over) should be decided and initiated if a single failure affects the fail-operational landing system (the probability of a second failure remains high and must be considered); - After which (below AH), if a single failure affects the fail-operational landing system, the approach and autoland can be continued (the probability of a second failure is negligible). FAIL-OPERATIONAL AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the remaining part of the automatic system allows the aircraft to complete the approach, flare, and landing. In the event of a failure, the automatic landing system operates as a fail-passive system. FAIL-PASSIVE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail passive means in case of a failure of any part of the system, the autoland system will turn itself off and the crew has to take over. An example of an autoland sequence: - Approach (APP) mode armed - Localizer and Glide Slope Armed - Localizer Capture - Glide Slope Capture - 400 - 330 feet RA: If FLARE is armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage. - At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA: The FLARE mode is automatically engaged - Roll-out FAILURES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS As a general rule, if a failure occurs above 1000 ft AGL, the approach may be continued if all required actions are completed, the updated approach briefing is performed and the appropriate Decision heigh/altitude set. Below 1000 ft (and down to Alert Height), the occurrence of any failure requires a go around and a reassessment of the landing capability. It has been considered that below 1000 ft, not enough time is available for the crew to perform the necessary switching, to check system configuration and limitation and brief for minima.",

Recently, feedback in the comments has indicated that this answer was correct, which is encouraging to see, but please continue to send any feedback about the correct answer or the question wording, thank you! So far, we think this question could be asking about 3 different things, the last of which is our best guess: How the autopilot works out the magnitude of aileron/roll spoiler inputs to use in roll modes. How the autopilot works out the maximum bank angle. How the autopilot works out how much bank angle to use for a specific turn. 1) In this question, the autopilot mainly takes input from the IAS/CAS, as the higher the CAS, the more sensitive the controls will be, so the lass aileron/roll spoiler input needed. It may also take altitude into account, due to the low aerodynamic damping at high altitude, which may be taken into consideration. Of course, the precise amount of deflection needed is created using a feedback loop, but the autopilot does need some inputs to make the process better. 2) In managed lateral modes (sometimes called LNAV for lateral navigation), the autopilot chooses the maximum bank angle that it can use independently of the pilots, and this takes into account high altitude effects, restrictions whilst at low altitude, etc. For this, it will use altitude input, and perhaps CAS/Mach No. inputs, but crucially, we do NOT think this requires a TAS or vertical speed input, as they would not give any useful information to our knowledge. 3) The managed lateral (LNAV) modes mentioned above calculate what angle of bank to perform a turn at, in order to make that turn correctly, following the calculated path. This requires input of the aircraft TAS, as well as some distances (from waypoint to waypoint, aircraft to waypoint, aircraft to the track when intercepting, etc.). As far as we can tell, this is the only interpretation of the question that actually gives a somewhat correct answer, even though the interpretation is a bit of a push and the answer is very vague, so we certainly do not like it.",

The successful completion of an automatic landing depends on various items such as the crosswind, headwind, tailwind, runway contamination, etc. that need to be within a certain range. Beyond the certified range of these variables, the automatic landing cannot be completed safely. As surprising as it might be, the Autoland capability can be useful on other occasions. For example, when both flight crew experience extreme fatigue and don’t take the risk of landing manually the aircraft, they can agree on an automatic landing. Obviously, this is not because the pilot flying will misjudge the flare or anything that is linked with the manual skills (although it could also be the cause), but mostly because if a go-around were to be executed, the autopilot would greatly reduce the workload and help the pilots to seat back and carefully manage the flight path of the airplane, flaps retraction, and missed approach procedure monitoring.",

Its purpose being to enable the pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch and/or roll, through the automatic control system without disconnecting the autopilot. The signals for the A/P are produced by transducers in the control column. Pressing a CWS engage switch, engages the A/P pitch and roll axes in the CWS mode and displays CWS P and CWS R on the FMAs. With CWS engaged, the A/P manoeuvres the aeroplane in response to control pressures applied by either pilot. The control pressure is similar to that required for manual flight. When control pressure is released, the A/P holds existing attitude. Touch Control Steering (TCS) Touch Control Steering (TCS) also permits a pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch or roll, but unlike CWS the appropriate automatic control channels and servomotors are disengaged while the TCS button is held depressed allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in the desired attitude using manual control. The autopilot control channels and servomotors are re-engaged by release of the TCS button and the autopilot continues to again hold the aircraft in the attitude in which it was left.",

Aircraft Stabilisation is the key function of an autopilot: The autopilot is capable of producing the same actions as the pilot to maintain aircraft stability in a shorter reaction time. The autopilot must detect the disturbance and then work out appropriate corrective action. It must then apply that correction using its “muscles” which will cause the aircraft to manoeuvre about its centre of gravity back towards its original position. Finally, it must detect that the correction has taken place and re-centre the controls. This is known as inner loop control (or sometimes closed loop or auto-stabilization). The basic autopilot provides enhanced stability over a greater range of ambient conditions. The most basic autopilot available will be of a type that will only provide auto-stabilization.",
