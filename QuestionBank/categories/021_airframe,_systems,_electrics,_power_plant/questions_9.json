            "explanation": "A reversible flight control system will have aerodynamic forces on the controls, therefore there is no need or an artificial feel system. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Note: We think that the different authorities have different versions of this question. Some mention that it is a Fly By Wire aircraft, some saying Airbus, and some saying specifically A320. It is the same answer for all these, and EASA are usually talking about A320s when they mention Fly By Wire anyway. We think the questions are similar enough to warrant only this one in the bank, but if further feedback says otherwise, we will add separate questions. Fly By Wire systems A fly by wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of Fly By Wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. This question used to be very ambiguous, but over the past year it has changed a few times, and now we know it is an Airbus (we believe it says A320 in some exam authorities) and it is flying at the critical angle of attack. As it is at its critical angle of attack, pulling back on the sidestick would make it initially attempt to climb, but as this would further increase the angle of attack and slow the aircraft, the flight envelope protections would step in and stop this pitching backwards. Therefore the only thing that can save us from this scenario is actually adding thrust. This will allow us to increase our speed, decreasing our AoA, and subsequently, the flight controls will allow us to begin a climb. This is the only way to induce any sort of climb from the very low energy state of the question. In fact, the Airbus A320 actually has a set of limiting angles of attack, where different measures will be taken one by one to stop an impending stall. One of those measures is automatically applying TO/GA (Take off/Go around) thrust. You are not expected to know this for the question, so do not assume that the aircraft will automatically do this if you keep pulling back. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.03.05: Explain the operating principle of rudder and aileron trim in a fully powered control system. There are two basic types of flight controls, reversible and irreversible. Reversible flight controls are those that have a two way force mechanism naturally as part of the system. This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (think powered steering in a car). The connecting factor is that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against, the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. There are pros and cons to both, but one benefit of irreversible controls such as fly by wire, is that trimming can be made easier. All a simple trim system needs to do is adjust where the system considers the \"zero\" point to be. Therefore the rudder (in this case) will sit naturally at the new \"zero\" point, which will produce a constant trim in a particular direction. Pitch trim can differ from this method though, and some manufacturers take their own stance on trimming, such as if the rudder pedals are supposed to move with the trim or not, etc.",

One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of severe windshear, the recommended way to gain altitude and escape the windshear is to apply maximum thrust and pitch up to a high attitude until reaching near the stall speed, then maintain that speed. In theory, a Fly-By-Wire aircraft can actually perform some of that for the pilot. Because of the stall protection of a Fly-By-Wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply full thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), but will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: this is not the way an Airbus pilot should actually fly a windshear escape manoeuvre, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing fly-by-wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems.",

These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

As Fly-By-Wire control systems have no manual back-up systems, and flight controls can be lost due to loss of power, loss of computers, loss of hydraulics, etc., they have multiple redundant systems to prevent this. In reality, they end up having more redundancy than some simpler systems, in the amount of separate systems that can be used as backups. For this question then, the correct answer is actually that FBW aircraft benefit from increased damage tolerance. Now we strongly believe that it very much depends on the type of damage and its location, but when you consider that FBW aircraft usually have 3 hydraulic systems and 3-4 flight control computers, you can see where the examiner is coming from. That is more redundant systems than simpler aircraft would usually have.",

In all cases of asymmetric flap, the wing with the greater amount of flap extended is producing a substantially higher amount of lift. At the same time, increased drag on the flaps-down side creates a pronounced adverse yaw situation, with the nose swinging toward the wing with most flaps deflected.",

Slats Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings of fixed-wing aircraft which, when deployed, allow the wing to operate at a higher angle of attack. At high angles of attack they allow the air over the wing to have much greater energy, allowing the aircraft to fly at much higher angles of attack without stalling. This allows the wing to produce a higher maximum coefficient of lift, and can therefore fly slower whilst still balancing the weight force with lift. Slats, like flaps, are therefore used for take-off, landing and slow flight, thereby reducing take-off and landing distances. Slats are still retracted for normal flight as they increase drag, similar to flaps. They are hydraulically powered, just like the flaps and other flight controls on large aircraft. Some aircrafts are equipped with an Auto-Slat System. This system enhances the airplane stalling characteristics. Upon receiving a signal from the stall warning system that the aircraft is close to the stall (high AoA), the auto-slat system automatically operates the slats, extending them from the midrange position to the fully extended landing position. The slats retract a few seconds after the signal is removed. This is a bit like a \"get out of jail free\" card, and allows a few extra degrees angle of attack before the wing completely stalls.",

As the pressure is increasing while it shouldn’t, the maximum pressure differential will be exceeded causing the safety relief valves to open. Pressurization System control methods The way the pressure in the aircraft is controlled is by having a constant mass of air entering the cabin through the airconditioning system. This mass of air is kept constant by the mass flow controller. The pressure is regulated by the amount of air which is discharged back to the atmosphere by the outflow valves. So the more open these valves are, the lower the pressure will be in the aircraft. There must be two safety measures in place with these kind of systems to avoid a too high pressure or too low when the outside pressure is higher than that of the cabin. Safety valve This is a mechanical pressure relief valve which should open when the cabin exceeds the maximum pressure differential to which the aircraft is designed. Inward relief valve This valve works the other way around than the safety valve and will open once the pressure outside of the aircraft is higher so there will be no negative pressure differential. These two valves may be combined in the same unit or may be two separate units, but there must be at least two of each installed. Instrumentation The indications needed for a pressurized cabin are: Cabin altimeter, this reads a cabin pressure but it is calibrated in a way that it reads the equivalent in altitude of the cabin Cabin vertical speed Indicator, this indicates the rate at which the cabin altitude is climbing or descending. Cabin Differential Pressure Gauge, indicates the difference in absolute pressure between the inside of the cabin and the pressure outside of the aircraft. In additional to these parameters there should be a visual and aural warning when the cabin exceeds an altitude of 10 000 ft.",

So when the pressure starts to decrease the rate of climb will increase as well as the cabin pressure altitude. As the differential pressure is the difference between the cabin pressure and that of the ambient pressure around the aircraft this will decrease. Pressurization System control methods The way the pressure in the aircraft is controlled is by having a constant mass of air entering the cabin through the airconditioning system. This mass of air is kept constant by the mass flow controller. The pressure is regulated by the amount of air which is discharged back to the atmosphere by the outflow valves. So the more open these valves are, the lower the pressure will be in the aircraft. There must be two safety measures in place with these kind of systems to avoid a too high pressure or too low when the outside pressure is higher than that of the cabin. Safety valve This is a mechanical pressure relief valve which should open when the cabin exceeds the maximum pressure differential to which the aircraft is designed. Inward relief valve This valve works the other way around than the safety valve and will open once the pressure outside of the aircraft is higher so there will be no negative pressure differential. These two valves may be combined in the same unit or may be two separate units, but there must be at least two of each installed. Instrumentation The indications needed for a pressurized cabin are: Cabin altimeter, this reads a cabin pressure but it is calibrated in a way that it reads the equivalent in altitude of the cabin Cabin vertical speed Indicator, this indicates the rate at which the cabin altitude is climbing or descending. Cabin Differential Pressure Gauge, indicates the difference in absolute pressure between the inside of the cabin and the pressure outside of the aircraft. In additional to these parameters there should be a visual and aural warning when the cabin exceeds an altitude of 10 000 ft.",

These two valves may be combined in the same unit or may be two separate units, but there must be at least two of each installed. Means of control The pressurization can be controlled either automatically or manually. When the system is set to automatic, the system uses the pressure controllers which in most commercial aircraft are electronic. When the cabin pressure changes the controller sends a signal to the outflow valves whether to open or close. These valves are then positioned to a position to achieve a selected rate of pressure increase or decrease. Some aircraft have a ditching mode which will close all valves to avoid water flowing into the cabin in the event of a forced landing on water. The outflow valves are fitted with two AC motors, these are used with automatic control, and one DC motor for manual or emergency operation. When the pressure is controlled manually all automatic functions will be disabled and enables the outflow valves to be positioned with the DC motor. So manual mode has a separate circuit for the operation.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

The point at which the air is bled from the engine varies by engine type but it is always tapped from the compressor. Usually, it is extracted from the 5th stage - Low pressure stage of the turbine's High pressure compressor. Its main use is to provide pressurized air for the cabin by supplying air to the air conditioning system, which provides a means of cooling since the bleed air supply is always at a higher temperature than required for passenger comfort. In flight on most large aircraft, pressurized air from the engine compressors is supplied continuously to the cabin, and the cabin pressure is then controlled by outflow valves.",

The outflow valves are positioned to regulate the release of air from the cabin at the pre-selected rate to achieve the required differential pressure and eventual stabilization at the selected cabin altitude. When the outflow valves stabilize (generally remain slightly open in cruise), providing that flight altitude (and ambient pressure) and air conditioning system settings remain unchanged => a constant air mass flow through the cabin is achieved.",

So the more open these valves are, the lower the pressure will be in the aircraft. There must be two safety measures in place with these kind of systems to avoid a too high pressure or too low when the outside pressure is higher than that of the cabin. Safety valve This is a mechanical pressure relief valve which should open when the cabin exceeds the maximum pressure differential to which the aircraft is designed. Inward relief valve This valve works the other way around than the safety valve and will open once the pressure outside of the aircraft is higher so there will be no negative pressure differential.

Control. Achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

            "explanation": "Most jet aircraft have pneumatic systems with 2 separate air conditioning packs. These usually use bleed air that has been taken from that side engine's compressor, thereby having a left pack which runs from left engine bleed air, and a right pack which runs off air from the right hand engine(s). The APU also feeds bleed air into the pneumatic system (usually to the left side). In the air, the system should operate normally with no interaction between the left and right side. There is an isolation valve between the two systems to either make them interconnected or completely separate. This is usually open on the ground when the engines are off to provide APU bleed air to both packs for cooling and to both engines for starting. It is closed in the air for split operation, unless an abnormal situation occurs, such as a loss of engine bleed air, pack failure, etc., when the isolation valve will either automatically be opened or the flight crew will open it to balance the load within the system. A significant pressure difference between the two sides of an isolation valve in the air is likely to mean that one of the sides has an issue that the other does not have. In the case of the Boeing 737 specifically (image shown above), the isolation valve opens automatically if any of the pack or engine bleed switches are NOT in their normal locations (bleeds on, packs auto) as the system knows that the pneumatics will become unbalanced in that case (bleed off, pack off, or pack set to high flow, etc.). It can be manually forced open or closed though by positioning the switch each side of the \"AUTO\" position. It is not good to feed bleed air into a leaky duct, though, so that is something to be careful of with pressure differentials. As for the other options: \"They close when the system pressure equals the environmental pressure.\" This is talking roughly about the pressurisation outflow valve. That is what controls the pressure in the cabin. \"They open when there is a leak in one of the systems.\" This is a bad thing, as we do not want to feed hot bleed air into a leaky air duct, due to overheating and potential loss of pressurisation. \"They close when the engines are at maximum thrust.\" Engines at high thrust produce more bleed air, but they will produce it to both sides of the pneumatic manifold, so isolation valve open or closed, it shouldn't make too much difference.",

It makes use of engine bleed air or APU pneumatic air during the conditioning process. Another system is electrically powered air conditioning which can be found in Boeing 787. Some advantages of electrically driven air conditioning system: Reduced fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There is no guidance on whether the initial cost of the electric-pneumatic system is cheaper than similar bleed air systems, and any engine system that reduced the take off distance would increase (not reduce) the climb gradient. The change in de-icing capabilities depends on the system. Ease of use also depends on the system. Bleed air pneumatic systems are quite easy to use so the difference will be minimal if there is one.",

A relief valve is fitted to prevent excessive pressure build up due to heating or system malfunction",

Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000 ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500ft/min for the climb and 300 ft/min for the descent. Instrumentation The indications needed for a pressurized cabin are: Cabin altimeter, this reads a cabin pressure but it is calibrated in a way that it reads the equivalent in altitude of the cabin Cabin vertical speed Indicator, this indicates the rate at which the cabin altitude is climbing or descending. Cabin Differential Pressure Gauge, indicates the difference in absolute pressure between the inside of the cabin and the pressure outside of the aircraft. In additional to these parameters there should be a visual and aural warning when the cabin exceeds an altitude of 10 000ft.",

It differs from the other systems in that the cooling of the charge air is mainly achieved by a refrigerant. \"Air from the turbine of the turbocharger\" is incorrect because the air from the turbine is already highly compressed and hot, which makes it unsuitable for the intended purpose. \"Ram air and an electric fan\" is incorrect as the vapor-cycle system does not operate using ram air or an electric fan for its cooling process. \"A vapour-cycle machine is a closed system, therefore a separate air source is not required.\" is incorrect because a vapor-cycle system necessitates an external source of high-pressure and high-temperature air to facilitate the cooling of the refrigerant and other components.

Cabin Differential Pressure. Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 and 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude. Control. Achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers.

In piston engine aircraft, different sources of air supply can be used, such as compressors, blowers or vacuum pumps. Those devices are driven by small electrical motors or directly by the engine and provide air for some instruments, de-icing and cabin. Compressors are able to handle more air while blowers and vacuum systems are used for lower demands. Ram air turbine may be used on larger aircraft as a backup hydraulic power source. Bleed air provides air supply for a gas turbine engine. Turbocharger is not necessarily running all the time and therefore would be of no use as air supply. Note: Superchargers can be used to provide pneumatic pressure, as they are effectively the same thing as an air compressor, just one that is usually used to provide extra Manifold Pressure to the engine intake air. This is why some textbooks and questions do refer to them as possible pneumatic pressure sources, but compressor pump is much more correct than turbocharger here, as turbochargers are not always working in an engine.",

            "explanation": "\"Cabin pressure differential\" is the actual pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the pressurized cabin of the aircraft. Locate the value of 38 000 ft in the first column on the left => continue horizontally to the right and read the corresponding pressure 2.99 PSI. The maximum allowed pressure differential is 8.17 PSI - that means that the cabin pressure is \"outside air pressure (2.99) + differential pressure (8.17)= 11.16 PSI\" Cabin altitude corresponding to 11.16 psi is found by interpolating 7000-8000 ft and 11.34-10.92 PSI. For the 0.42 PSI change between 11.34 PSI (7000 ft) and 10.92 (8000 ft) PSI, the change in altitude is 1000 ft in total. So each 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft. We can calculate 11.16 PSI cabin pressure based on 11.34 PSI or 10.92 PSI. Let's base it on 11.34 PSI. The difference between this and the cabin pressure we calculated is 0.18 (11.34 - 11.16) PSI. Since every 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft, a change of 0.18 PSI causes an altitude change of 429 ft (23.81 x 18). If we add this value to our base altitude (7000 ft), the result is 7429 ft. (We added it because the altitude increases as the PSI decreases) The closest answer is 7430 ft.",

As both would actually be covered by the same correct answer, there is no problem. We strongly believe that it is talking about pressure control, but we can cover all bases here anyway. Temperature control of the air conditioning system in a jet transport aircraft comes from controlling the mixing of two streams of air - hot and cold - whch come from different stages of the bleed air conditioning packs. Some aircraft have automatic valves to control the internal temperature of the air, if this does not work, the valve can sometimes be manually controlled from the flight deck. This all depends on the aircraft type of course. PRESSURISATION SYSTEMS Cabin pressurization is achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape. The operation of the outflow valves is governed by the pressure controller when in automatic control => as the cabin pressure changes, the controller automatically transmits a signal to the outflow valves. If the automatic control fails, the position of the outflow valve can be controlled by the flight crew in manual mode => the outflow valve position can be varied by means of the main outflow valve control and with reference to the cabin altitude gauge and the valve position indicator.",

So the difference between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure. With a drop in cabin pressure the difference between the cabin pressure and ambient pressure will decrease. Pressurization As modern aircraft operate more efficiently at high altitudes, it is necessary to pressurize the cabin to allow the crew and passengers to function normally without the need for additional oxygen. Up to an altitude of 10000ft the air pressure is sufficient for humans to operate without any issues. Above this altitude the lack of oxygen can become an issue for the performance of the crew and the wellbeing of the passengers. Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500ft/min for the climb and 300ft/min for the descent. Typical maximum pressure differential for commercial aircraft are between 8 and 9 psi.",

Therefore, the usual (and very easy) answer of the bleed air duct leak indicator light is no longer correct, because there is no such light in the cabin, only in the flight deck. The bleed air in the pneumatic system is usually fed from a \"bleed air source\" in a gas turbine engine, which is effectively just air that has already gone through some of the compressor stages and is siphoned off to pressurise the system (not burnt). It is then distributed through pipes to the various parts of the aircraft where it is needed, such as the air conditioning packs or the leading edges of the wings and tailplane for de/anti-icing. The bleed air is very hot (a temperature of 400°C is sometimes quoted, for context) and so any leaks of these pipes could be harmful to the passengers or the other aircraft equipment. Thankfully, it is usually kept far away from passengers, for just this reason, so the first sign of a duct leak in the cabin would likely be reduction in airflow coming through the vents. This is because less air is fed into the air conditioning packs (as some of it has leaked out), so less air is able to be cooled and sent to the cabin vents. The cabin pressure will not drop rapidly as the loss of pressurisation is small, depending on the location of the duct leak, and the outflow valve will close naturally to keep the remaining pressure inside. It could be argued that the cabin temperature could rise above normal limits, but this is highly dependent on the location of the leak. The majority of the bleed air lines exist in the wings and underbelly of the aircraft (mostly unpressurised areas) so the chance of the passenger cabin being heated by this is quite slim, but some aircraft equipment could certainly be damaged.",

Some airplanes do not need the horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer to have de-icing/anti-icing systems because it was shown during flight testing that there were no adverse effects from having ice on the tail. This is mainly because horizontal stabilizer/elevator has been designed so that even with a degradation of lift due to the ice, it still produces a sufficient tail down force to maintain control, even when approaching the stall speed. For vertical stabilizers also ice accretion does not create any significant control problems. Most jet airlines do not have such systems installed. The airplanes that do have and require anti-ice may be fitted with de-icing boots. (Mostly, turboprops as they are exposed more to icing conditions) Some designs are also more prone to collecting ice (based mainly on the radius of the leading edge) so must demonstrate sufficient handling qualities with even more ice, which may not be possible.",

Hot air anti-ice systems are installed on most turbojet and some turboprop aeroplanes. This is because a turbine engine has an easy source of hot air that can be used to heat aerofoil leading edges or engine cowlings. This is \"bleed\" air, which is taken from the high pressure, hot air in the engine compressors. Engine cowlings: On a turbojet/turbofan engine, the leading edges of the cowlings are usually heated with hot bleed air as an \"anti-icing\" system, which prevents ice from forming in the first place. Wing leading edges: These can be fed by hot bleed air, but require much greater volumes of bleed air than the engine cowlings, so are more commonly used as a \"de-icing\" system, where ice that has already formed can be removed.",

Learning Objective 021.07.02.01.01: Describe the different operating principles of the following ice detectors: mechanical systems using air pressure; electromechanical systems using resonance frequencies. Piezoelectric sensors are very interesting. They create a linkage between movement and electric signals via the stress of a particular \"piezoelectric\" crystal. In this case, they are used to measure vibrations of an ice detection sensor. This is usually a small rod that sticks out from the aircraft fuselage and vibrates at the natural frequency of the rod, but any ice buildup will cause that natural frequency to change, and this change will be sensed by the piezoelectric crystal, triggering a warning for the pilots that ice buildup has been detected.",

Some airplanes don't need the horizontal stabilizer to have anti-ice because it was shown during flight testing that there were no adverse effects from having ice on the tail.

All these components can be de-iced when ice is detected, except for the engines, which have to be anti-iced, as any ice build up could fall into the engine when dislodged and potentially cause a flame out or even damage. On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft. As for this question, the answers beginning with \"prevents\" are correct (anti-icing rather than de-icing), and the ice does not form on the trailing edge of a wing (it can flow over the trailing edge in extreme cases but does not \"form\" there), so therefore the correct answer has to be that it \"prevents the formation of ice on engine inlets.\"",

Learning Objective 021.07.02.01.02: Describe the principle of operation of ice warning systems. Some aircraft are fitted with ice detection systems which show the pilots a warning when ice acccumulation has been detected, often on a small probe. Some aircraft rely simply on visual references, such as the buildup of ice on the windshield wipers, or other items within view of the pilots. This is a design consideration of the aircraft, and the pilots must be able to see indications of ice accretion as they occur, particularly in large jet aircraft where the pilot cannot see the wing easily. As the ice warning is a design consideration, the indications of icing should be visible when the pilot has the correct eye reference position. If they do not have the correct eye position, then they may not be able to see the ice build up, preventing them from performing the correct procedures.",

This compressed air driven from the compressor is known as bleed air. When selecting the bleed air ‘ON’ some of the air will be sucked out of the normal flow inside the engine and will induce some inconveniences and risks. In fact, the mass flow of air will be reduced, which will increase the engine’s overall temperature, especially the turbine temperature since less air is available for cooling. It also increases specific fuel consumption and the EGT and the power output (or thrust) will be decreased, in other words, aircraft, and more precisely engine performance will greatly be decreased. Because of all this, it is normal to see PACKS OFF take-off, since all the available power is needed during this critical stage of the flight. Conducting a PACKS OFF take-off also has the advantage of reducing the required thrust and the noise footprint.",

On many reciprocating-engine and turboprop airplanes, de-icing boots are pneumatically inflated for a few seconds to break the ice, which allows it to be carried away by the airstream. A high-pressure de-icing boot is a fabric-reinforced rubber sheet that contains built in inflation tubes. The boots are installed in sections along each leading-edge surface. This system can be triggered from the flight deck. In another system, primarily used by turbine-powered aeroplanes, heated air is directed through ducting in the aerofoil leading edge, to thermally prevent ice from forming. This is referred to as thermal anti-ice system. Note: Pneumatic de-icing boots do not prevent ice formation, these are de-icing systems only.",

Applying similar liquids to airframe surfaces in flight can have comparable benefits. These systems are usually called weeping wings and typically protect wings, tail surfaces, propellers and windshields. Modern systems use leading edge panels that are either laser drilled with thousands of small holes, or fitted with fine stainless steel mesh. In operation, a pump forces a mixture of ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and water through the holes. This fluid runs back over the surface, forming a thin liquid film that prevents structural ice from forming. The anti-icing fluid is stored in a reservoir that holds enough fluid to provide two or more hours of ice protection when flying in moderate icing conditions.",

If at cruising level, this might not be enough to maintain altitude, and a drift-down procedure may be required. Remember that this is a lot less bad than losing one engine out of two. One thing to think about is that the right hand engines are usually fed from the right hand wing tanks, and the left hand engines from the left wing tanks. If an engine fails and the aircraft is not going to land immediately, then it is a good idea to make sure all available fuel pumps are on and open up the crossfeed valve (if available) to make sure that the engines all have access to fuel, and that one tank does not run dry before the others. This also helps to keep the aircraft balanced. None of the other options are really necessary in the situation, and descending would make the engines less fuel efficient (though would allow for higher thrust output).",

The sealed skin and structural members provide the highest volume of space available with the lowest weight => this is otherwise unused space inside the wings. Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have wet wings. RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

The plates of the capacitor can hold only a certain amount of electric charge. This amount depends on the distance between the two plates, the area of the plates and the insulating properties of the dielectric. As you can imagine, the area of the plates and the distance between is not going to change over time, they’re fixed. So, the only variable is going to be the dielectric.

Jet fuel is kerosene based, and is very similar to diesel fuel in many ways, but lacks the same lubricating effect of motor diesel, so the diesel piston engines are specially modified or developed to remove this issue. In terms of which jet fuels can be used in a diesel aero-engine, please see the above annex for the generic AFM for a Diamond DA-42 which uses diesel based aero-engines. You will note that there are different fuel names and specifications for different world regions, but in Europe and the US, Jet A-1 is by far the most common. Even diesel itself can only be used in the DA42 if certain modifications are in place. The inclusion of AVTUR in the options is a little troubling. Please understand that Jet A-1 is certainly most correct, both theoretically and in reality when flying around Europe, but AVTUR (aviation turbine fuel) is a word that can mean a few different things. It can be an umbrella term for all aviation turbine fuels, but its first use was as a term for JP-1, an early jet fuel developed by the US military, which is not still used today.",

These filters are typically installed at the fuel tank outlet. Subsequently, the HP fuel pump elevates the fuel pressure to fulfill the requirements of the engine-driven fuel pump and fuel injectors. Meanwhile, the FUEL CONTROL UNIT (FCU) acts as a precise fuel metering device, regulating fuel flow to the engine. Due to their high precision, it's crucial for the fuel supplied to them to be clean and free of contaminants. Micronic filters, positioned before the FCU, ensure this cleanliness. These fuel filters are positioned upstream of the FCU to safeguard the delicate components within both the HP fuel pump and the FCU.

            ],
            "explanation": "1. In a piston engine, the fuel supply must be gravity-fed fuel. - incorrect In piston-engine aircraft, fuel can be supplied to the engine through either gravity-fed or pump-fed systems. Gravity-fed fuel systems are typically found in high-wing aircraft, where the fuel tanks are positioned above the engine. Gravity allows the fuel to flow naturally from the tanks to the engine without the need for fuel pumps. However, many piston-engine aircraft, especially those with low-wing configurations, use fuel pumps because the fuel tanks are located below the engine. In these cases, mechanical or electric fuel pumps are essential to supply fuel to the engine. Therefore, it is not mandatory for piston-engine fuel supplies to be gravity-fed; the fuel supply method depends on the aircraft's design. 2. In gas turbine engines, fuel tanks must be in low wing configuration. - incorrect Gas turbine engine aircraft can have fuel tanks in various configurations, not exclusively in low-wing designs. While many jet aircraft feature low-wing configurations with fuel tanks integrated into the wings, there are numerous exceptions. High-wing aircraft, such as some turboprop and cargo planes (e.g., the C-130 Hercules), also use gas turbine engines and have fuel tanks located in the wings or fuselage. The placement of fuel tanks in gas turbine engine aircraft is determined by factors like aircraft size, purpose, and design requirements—not solely by the engine type. Therefore, it is not a necessity for gas turbine engine fuel tanks to be in a low-wing configuration.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is almost exactly the same as question 218090, but the correct answer is very slightly different. The answer to question 218090 is slightly more correct in our opinion, but this one is also sufficiently correct, in comparison to the other options. The priming system consists of a priming pump that will deliver fuel to the induction manifold. Its whole purpose is to inject additional fuel in the cylinders intake ports to assist the engine start. As this extra fuel now lines the intake ports/inlet manifold to one or more of the cylinders, and is very volatile, it will evaporate into the air flowing into the cylinders, giving the necessary fuel/air mixture to start the engine. The \"inlet manifold\" is the area just before the intake air gets split up to each individual cylinder, so priming this area will prime the fuel to all cylinders, but we consider this to be almost exactly the same meaning as injecting fuel into the intake ports. In the absence of such a system, it is possible (but more likely to cause a fire hazard) to deliver more fuel to the cylinders by pumping the throttle lever which will act on the accelerator pump and deliver more fuel from the carburettor. Unfortunately, this method coats the earlier intake lines with fuel, and may therefore catch fire unintentionally if the excess fuel drips onto hot components, etc. The priming pump may be electrical or manual, and will be fitted in parallel with the main fuel pump (which is either electric or mechanical) and will take fuel from the filter housing and channel it to the nozzles at the inlet manifold/intake ports. The necessary amount of priming required will mainly depend on the ambient temperature and how long the engine hasn’t been running. Priming is mostly necessary for the first flight of the day and during cold weather after the engine has been off for a few hours (depending on the engine type). However, sometimes it is not even needed as the engine will perfectly start without priming. Over-priming a hot engine could lead to a buildup of excessive fuel inside the cylinders (flooding), potentially increasing the risk of engine fire, flooding the engine, and fouling the spark plugs. Whilst pumping the throttle can work, it is not really made for \"priming\", more providing extra fuel to the engine once running, and is therefore not preferred. There is no hole in the spark plug for fuel, and please, please don't rotate a propeller with the throttle wide open. If the magnetos are unintentionally on or the engine has a hot spot then a cylinder could fire and cause serious injury.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question isn't very good, and there are two slightly correct answers here (none that we consider fully correct), but we believe that one is more correct than the other. AIRCRAFT FUEL TANKS INTEGRAL TANKS: Integral Tanks are used on all modern large passenger aircraft and, as its name suggests, a tank is formed as an unit within the airframe structure by sealing part of the structure of the wings or fuselage with a fuel resistant two-part sealant. The sealed skin and structural members provide the highest volume of space available with the lowest weight => this is otherwise unused space inside the wings. Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have \"wet wings\". RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accommodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. They are common on light aircraft. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. So out of these options then, both mentioning maintenance are incorrect. Fuel bladder tanks are great for maintenance as they can be removed completely if necessary. Of the other two options, \"easily punctured\" is neither fully correct nor incorrect, as yes, they can be punctured, of course, but they are often made puncture resistant and may even be self-sealing against punctures. The wrinkles are the only potential problem here, and whilst they are relatively unlikely due to the fixing of the bladder to the aircraft structure, badly designed or incorrectly fixed tanks could easily wrinkle, at which point a few precious litres of fuel become unusable by the engines, and this is certainly a problem.",

To address the incorrect options: The fuel is not transferred between tanks, fuel balancing will usually be done by feeding an engine from the other side fuel tank to burn more fuel from that side. Unusable fuel being used for engine cooling would be a terrible idea, as the fuel could ignite and cause an engine fire. Fuel tanks can still be isolated in the event of a fuel leak by feeding both engines from the tank which is not leaking.",

Given the statements, we think the question will be laid out in this way, but this is not assured yet. It could also be a choice of which statements are correct (1, 2 and 4, etc.) with different wording for the statements. For a gravity fed fuel system to work, there is no pump needed to get the fuel to the engine from the tanks (booster pumps are often fitted for use during critical phases of flight), so the fuel is pressurised and fed from the tank(s) to the engine by gravity. The fuel must therefore be stored above the carburettor and engine, such as in a high wing aircraft like a Cessna 152. The weight of fuel on the rest of the fuel in the lines is what pushes it into the carburettor (for a carburetted engine). If the engine was injected, a high pressure pump would be required before the injector to provide the injection pressure, but the system could still be “gravity fed”. As for the other options; A fuel gauge is just as required as it would be in any fuel system. In fact, in some gravity fed aircraft, you can actually see the fuel in the tanks, so they act as their own fuel gauges. We're not sure if the examiner is saying that gravity fed aircraft don't need fuel gauges, or they don't need them any more that pump-fed aircraft do. As mentioned above, the engine could still be fuel injected. The fuel would be gravity fed from the tanks to the high pressure pump just before the fuel injectors. We would say that this is not \"true\" gravity feeding, but it seems to still count, particularly as a low pressure pump is not required to get the fuel out of the tanks. They don't need an electric fuel pump to operate (but may have a boost pump fitted for crucial phases of flight).",

This means that the fuel tanks can be located underneath the engines, and that any engine can be fed from any tank, via pressurised crossfeeding. This is particularly useful with multi-engine aircraft which can have engine failures, to allow fuel balancing in that eventuality. Pressure feed fuel systems are the opposite of purely gravity fed fuel systems, where the tank must be sufficiently over the engine to push the fuel through the lines to the engine. Pressure feed systems have a few advantages over gravity fed fuel systems: The aircraft can be more manoeuvrable as the fuel feeding will not stop if the local gravity changes (during harsh manoeuvres). The fuel flow is more consistent due to higher pressure, less chance of vapour lock and also during manoeuvring the fuel flow will not cut out. The fuel tanks can be anywhere in the aircraft and be pumped to engines which can be anywhere, unlike gravity fed systems which have obviously very strict requirements. Fuel can also be cross-fed, etc. to balance tanks. This makes the aircraft design much more flexible. Disadvantages of pressure feed systems include the fact that gravity fed systems are less complex and therefore reduce weight. They are also not reliant on electric or engine driven fuel pumps.",

Jet B is much rarer, but is used for aircraft that operate in very cold climates, and has a freezing point of -60°C. Jet B has a lower freezing point, but also a lower flash point, meaning that it could set on fire if lit at normal ground temperatures. This is why it is known as a \"wide cut fuel\", and it is not approved for commercial air transport in the EU. Jet A and Jet A-1 have a minimum flash point of 38°C, which means that they are not too likely to be flammable during refuelling, etc. AVGAS is not suitable for use in gas turbine engines.",

            "explanation": "Note: We have only received one count of feedback for this question so far, and it would be very useful to get more feedback to try and confirm the wording and answer here. As yet we are happy with this as the correct answer, but confirmation would be very useful, thank you! The wording of this question is very misleading in our opinion, as without type-specific knowledge, this is very difficult to answer, but we will try and give you the best information we can. Fuel jettisoning systems are required on an aircraft when there is a large difference between the maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and the maximum landing weight (MLW). For a B737 for instance, there is a large difference between these two figures, however overweight landings are approved up to the MTOW of the aircraft if necessary, so no fuel jettison system is required, as any issues in flight, the crew can just perform an overweight landing as soon as necessary. On a larger aircraft, however, the maximum landing weight can be 100 tonnes less than the MTOW, so fuel jettison systems are necessary. Fuel jettison systems are obviously an inherent threat, as anything that removes fuel (and therefore airborne time) from the aircraft is at a high risk of a small error having big consequences. This is why there are protections in place. For starters, jettison systems are usually separate systems from those which feed the engines. Checking some aircraft types which have fuel jettisoning, the B777 has separate jettison pumps that go through specific jettison lines to the jettison valves, and the A340 has jettison valves placed on the refuelling/transfer system. This means that there is no single point of failure which causes unwanted jettisoning of fuel, as if the valves became fixed open, the pumps could be switched off, etc. We have been able to attach a replication of the fuel schematic for a 4 engine aircraft above, notice that the two fuel systems (refuelling/transfer/jettison vs the engine feed) are separate. Also, there is a further method of protection in the tanks, and there is usually a standpipe or other mechanical method that prevents fuel being jettisoned below a certain fuel tank level. This means that there is always enough fuel left for approach and landing (likely also a missed approach), even if the fuel jettison system got rid of everything. This protects for multiple system failures and some amount of human error.",

It vapourises because the fuel pressure is too low, and this allows the molecules to very easily break apart into a gas (remember that some types of fuel are very volatile and prone to becoming a gas anyway). This is effectively the same as the fuel \"boiling\", but due to low pressure rather than very high temperature. This is quite similar to how water boils at a much lower temperature at high altitudes, and you'll struggle to get a good cup of tea on top of Mount Everest, as the water never gets hot enough, boiling at around 65ºC. Low pressure reduces boiling points, as the molecules don't want to be together as much. To prevent vapour locking and cavitation, a low-pressure pump is fitted to the feed line and will supply fuel from the tanks at suitable pressure and flow. Under certain circumstances when the engine is very hot, vapor lock can also occur in the injector lines and prevent the fuel from being correctly delivered to the cylinders.",

Fuel System Icing Inhibitors (FSII) are utilized to lower the freezing point of any water present in the fuel system, thereby preventing the formation of ice crystals that could impede fuel flow. In summary, additives aid in minimizing the formation of ice crystals in cold temperatures. As the fuel is heated en route to the engine, any ice crystals revert to a fluid state, allowing the fuel to be combusted as usual. Note: The terms \"waxing\" or \"gelling\" refer to the transformation of jet fuel into a partially crystalline (solid) state under low temperatures.",

Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have wet wings. RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

This has an affect on the aircraft's flight characteristics, being that a forward CG requires more nose-up trim, which causes a downforce on the horizontal stabiliser, and therefore means that the main wing is lifting a heavier load. This leads to increased drag (sometimes called trim drag), increased stall speed, lower maximum altitude, etc. This is oposed to an aft CG, which reduces all those negative effects, for the trade-off of reduced stability. This makes it useful for us to be able to change the CG of the aircraft so we do not have to contend with as much trim drag. To do this, a trim fuel tank can be fitted in the rear of the aircraft, which is usually tranferred and then burnt at the correct time to ensure peak efficiency, with the best possible CG position. This is the reason they are fitted in the tail of the aircraft, as that is the place furthest away from the CG, to have the greatest effect. An interesting side note, Concorde had such trim tanks in the tail of the aircraft, and fuel would be pumped to them to bring the CG backwards when accelerating through the transonic range, in order to counteract the effects of Mach tuck. This drastically reduced the drag of a conventional Mach trim system, and the reverse would occur when the aircraft decelerated back to subsonic flight again.",

Conversely, light aircraft gauge quantity by measuring volume (in liters and gallons) through the adjustment of resistance using a float. However, this method is susceptible to maneuvering inaccuracies and cannot adjust for density fluctuations. Further reading: The working principle of a capacitance-type fuel gauging system is based on the variation of the capacitor’s dielectric. The dielectric is the solution found between the two plates of the capacitor, so in our system, they are the fuel and the air. The plates of the capacitor can hold only a certain amount of electric charge. This amount depends on the distance between the two plates, the area of the plates and the insulating properties of the dielectric. The float-type fuel gauging system consists of a simple mechanical float sitting on the fuel level and linked via a mechanical arm to a gauge indicating the volume. One of the main limitations of the volume indicating systems is that temperature variations will impact the reading of the tanks’ actual fuel quantity. The reading will also be imprecise during maneuvers, accelerations, and turbulence; the reading will only be reliable in straight and level flight.",

The fuel must therefore be stored above the carburettor and engine, such as in a high wing aircraft like a Cessna 152. The weight of fuel on the rest of the fuel in the lines is what pushes it into the carburettor (for a carburetted engine). If the engine was injected, a high pressure pump would be required before the injector to provide the injection pressure, but the system could still be “gravity fed”. As for the other options, they are just as necessary (or less so) in a gravity fed system as in a fuel pump driven system. Fuel flow and pressure sensors are useful in some systems, but not required in most, and a pressure relief valve is much less required in a gravity fed system as the pressures involved are usually much lower.",

This question poses the scenario of having low fuel in the left tank for some reason, and asks how to deal with this. Of course, as with any imbalance, crossfeed is usually the way forward. It is important to note that crossfeed does not transfer fuel between tanks, but instead allows both engines to be fed from the other tank. By opening the crossfeed valve, either engine can take fuel from either tank, so how do we stop the system from running out of fuel in the left tank? We have to make sure that the pressure of fuel being pumped out of the right tank is significantly higher than the pressure of fuel from the left tank. We do this by turning the Low Pressure AC fuel pumps from the left tank off completely, and leaving the fuel pumps on from the right tank, so the fuel is taken from the right tank as priority. None of this fuel can flow into the left tank due to the non-return valves, so just feeds both engines at once, burning down the amount of fuel in the right tank until the tanks are equal. Note that in the crossfeeding scenario, if the right tank pumps failed, then both engines could be fed from the suction of the HP engine pumps from either tank, without any AC pumps required, it is just less ideal and more prone to problems. Note: do not worry that the cross-feed valve is open in the question figure, it is just a figure to help you see the layout of the fuel system.",

Remark: For completion of list, please see 021.08 01.02 (02). Often aircraft will have a CG that changes significantly during flight, mostly due to fuel burn. This has an effect on the aircraft's flight characteristics, being that a forward CG requires more nose-up trim, which causes a downforce on the horizontal stabiliser, and therefore means that the main wing is lifting a heavier load. This leads to increased drag (sometimes called trim drag), increased stall speed, lower maximum altitude, etc. This is opposed to an aft CG, which reduces all those negative effects, for the trade-off of reduced stability. This makes it useful for us to be able to change the CG of the aircraft so we do not have to contend with as much trim drag. To do this, a trim fuel tank can be fitted in the rear of the aircraft, which is usually transferred and then burnt at the correct time to ensure peak efficiency, with the best possible CG position. This is the reason they are fitted in the tail of the aircraft, as that is the place furthest away from the CG, to have the greatest effect. An interesting side note, Concorde had such trim tanks in the tail of the aircraft, and fuel would be pumped to them to bring the CG backwards when accelerating through the transonic range, in order to counteract the effects of Mach tuck. This drastically reduced the drag of a conventional Mach trim system, and the reverse would occur when the aircraft decelerated back to subsonic flight again.",

Please send any further feedback to us via the comments, the question feedback section, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Vents in fuel tanks can hold two purposes. Some vents allow excess fuel to escape if the tanks have been overfilled or if the fuel has expanded due to heating. All vents provide atmospheric pressure to the fuel tank, so the space inside doesn't form a small vacuum as the fuel is burnt. Any such vacuum effect could cause problems with taking the fuel out of the tank towards the engines. Most vents provide slightly more than atmospheric pressure by pointing forwards and making use of the ram air to put a \"head of pressure\" on the fuel tank, helping the fuel pumps and reducing cavitation.",

RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

            "explanation": "In a large aircraft fuel system, there are usually 2 stages of fuel pumps. Just before the engines are the high pressure (HP) pumps which provide the correct pressure to the fuel nozzles. The suction from these pumps can suck fuel straight out of the tanks, through the fuel lines, however, this is usually supplemented by the addition of low pressure (LP) fuel pumps to suck fuel out of the tank and push it into the fuel lines. This pressurises the fuel in the lines, preventing vapour lock and cavitation. Cavitation is where an object moves through a liquid too quickly, and \"tears\" the liquid, creating gas bubbles in the liquid, even when no gas is present. This can reduce the output pressure of the pumps and therefore reduce fuel flow to the engines. It is much harder to do when the liquid is under pressure, so is more likely at high altitude when the air pressure is not pushing down on the liquid as much inside the fuel tanks. As discussed above, cavitation is reduced by pressurising the fuel, in smaller aircraft by using ram air to push down on the fuel in the tank, and in larger aircraft with LP pumps to pressurise the fuel lines. The failure of LP pumps does not stop the engines from receiving fuel, but cavitation and vapour lock (gas bubbles in the fuel lines) can cause fuel interruptions to the engine.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on student feedback, the official question includes an attachment illustrating the conditions mentioned in the question text. However, we have not yet obtained access to this official attachment. Whenever there is an unexpected fuel quantity indication, a message related to fuel in the FMC or engine display, or an imbalance condition arises, it's essential to consider the possibility of a fuel leak. Detecting a fuel leak can be aided by maintaining a fuel log and comparing the actual fuel burn to the planned fuel burn as part of the flight. It's important to note that there is no specific onboard warning for a fuel leak; it must be identified through changes or discrepancies in expected fuel consumption. Before engaging in any crossfeeding operations, it's crucial to ascertain that a fuel leak is not the root cause of the issue, as it could lead to total fuel loss. Pay close attention to parameters such as fuel flow, fuel usage, and total fuel quantity indications before deactivating any pump switches. If there is suspicion of an inflight fuel leak, take the following steps: turn off the fuel pumps for the center wing tank and close the crossfeed valve. Monitor the fuel tank quantity for any unusual drops and be alert to signs of a fuel imbalance, as these indicators can help confirm the presence of an engine fuel leak. Once an engine fuel leak is confirmed, either through visual observation or flight deck indications, it's imperative to shut down the affected engine to halt the leak and preserve the remaining fuel. After shutting down the affected engine, resume normal fuel management procedures. All remaining fuel can be utilized to power the operational engine safely.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

            "explanation": "Let's go through each answer: \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the difference between maximum load limit for flaps extended and clean wing is necessary as structural strength of the wing is lower with flaps extended.\" This is saying that the wing is weaker when flaps are extended. This is not correct, as the wing structure does not rely of the flaps. What actually causes the lower maximum load factor with flaps extended is the flap mechanism. With flaps extended, the higher the load factor, the more force is travelling through the mechanism which locks the flaps down, which are moving parts, so not as strong as the wing itself. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor with flaps extended will be higher than the load factor in the clean configuration.\" The load factor is simply lift/weight, and in straight and level flight, the lift will always equal the weight, therefore the load factor is 1, whether the flaps are up and down. It has not specified straight flight, but the same would be true in a turn of a particular bank angle; load factor is the same, with or without flaps. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the margin between current load factor and maximum load factor decreases with increased bank angle.\" Correct. In a level turn, the aircraft's wings have to produce a higher lift force, as the lift force is no longer straight upwards, but is instead pointing into the direction of turn somewhat. The steeper the bank angle, the greater the lift force has to be (to remain level), which means that the actual load factor has to increase. As the maximum load factor is a fixed value, the margin between actual and maximum decreases with increased bank angle. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor at which structural damage occurs can never be more than +2.0G when flaps are extended.\" We had no feedback for this option, so made this up to fill in the gap. It is incorrect because flaps can be made as strong as you like. They could manage up to +15G if the manufacturer wants to. There are minimum values to their strength though, defined in the certification specifications.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft manoeuvres, for instance by entering a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular for this scenario, an increased load on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain present. Therefore, for this question, any force increase will increase the stress on the aircraft (as stress is force per unit area) and any stress will increase strain (the aircraft's deformation due to the stress).",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.01.02.01.01: Explain how stress and strain are always present in an aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark: Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a material. An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. For instance, when stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. Also, The weight of the whole aircraft is being opposed by reaction forces that travel through the landing gear and all the structurally load bearing components of the structure. These are amongst the many forces acting on a stationary aeroplane. The forces are very different when flying in straight and level (1 G) flight, where, for instance, the wings are suspending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. The rest of the aircraft also sustains new forces, such as that of pressurisation on the pressure hull. The forces change again during manoeuvres, taxi, take-off and landing. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times.",

Fail-safe: When a structure fails there is alternative load-path provided by an adjacent part which is able to take over the loads for a limited amount of time. This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. “existence of more than one load path” This complies with the Fail-Safe design. “replacement of a part after a given number of cycles or hours of use” This is a Safe-Life design. “inability to withstand a certain amount of weakening of the structure without catastrophic failure” Note that it states Inability, a fail-safe design can withstand some weakening because the loads will be carried by adjacent structures. “impossibility to inspect the structure” This does not really have something to do with a fail-safe design, also airplanes are designed that practically everything can be inspected.",

Over the ocean at low altitude, the air will have a high salinity, leading to a build up of salt on the airframe, which, when mixed with water, can lead to fast corrosion of metal. The best way to deal with the operator's problem would be to wash the aircraft as often as they can, and very thoroughly, to clear off the salt and replace it with clean water that corrodes metal much less. The correct option (rightly) mentions the engine too, as this can build up salt deposits in just the same way as the airframe does, and corrosion is obviously much more dangerous when there are pieces of metal spinning at 50 000 RPM. Whilst the best long term fix for this issue would be changing the fleet of aircraft to ones more suited to the task, this would be immensely expensive, and maybe not even possible. Yes, if you were doing some light aircraft intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance work, then you could change to a fleet of composite aircraft to remove the risk of corrosion, which is a huge investment, but there are aircraft available for that type of operation, so is possible. However, if you were doing oil spill response or something which requires large jets, they are all metal and all subject to corrosion (except some of the newer jets like B787 and A350), so this answer is not feasible.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us using the comments, the feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Cyclic loading is the application of repeated or fluctuating stresses, strains, or stress intensities to locations on structural components. For instance, a cyclic load may be on the fuselage on each landing as a result of the impact on touchdown or the force of pressurisation on the fuselage and bulkheads, which increases and decreases regularly per flight. The degradation that may occur at the location is referred to as fatigue degradation or failure. Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. We are therefore saying that the correct answer here is \"cyclic loads\", but cyclic loads can also be considered to be dynamic loads as they change in intensity (not static loads), so we think it is misleading to have both options present. The other two options are not even close to being correct.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are three types of load, but they are not completely mutually exclusive. Static loads are loads that do not change in size, position or direction. These could be loads such as the weight of the aircraft through the wheels when parked, or the tension on the upper skin of the wing when on the ground. They are quite easy to account for. Dynamic loads are loads that do change in size, position or direction. They must be accounted for more heavily by engineers, as a constantly changing load can cause more fatigue or early failure if not expected. There are countless dynamic loads on an aircraft, taxiing loads, the engine pylons, the bending of the wing spar in turbulent flight, the control surfaces during manoeuvring, etc. Cyclic loads are a special type of the aforementioned loads. They are loads which have expected cycles, the main one being the pressurisation cycle of the aircraft. It is a static load when non-pressurised and when fully pressurised, but dynamic as it changes. The cyclical nature does mean that engineers can build it to last, and monitor it's progress also, giving an aircraft a number of available pressurisation cycles, which can dictate its lifespan. This question simply wants you to know that there are constantly loads of all types occuring on an aircraft at all times. static loads also occur whilst in flight, and dynamic loads occur on the ground, even when parked (wind, boarding, etc.), so the two statements are both incorrect.",

Unfortunately, the wording makes this question rather difficult to answer at all, and the answer we evaluated as \"most correct\" is not correct in the exams. Please send any exam feedback you can remember to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Large aircraft are built to be flown almost continuously. After an aircraft has been parked for any significant length of time (it is unclear how long this is classed to be - anecdotal reports indicate as little as a week of being parked), the aircraft must be checked over by an engineer, subject to engine runs, fully powered-up, etc., to inspect for airworthiness. It is very difficult to find authoritative documents for this, as it will vary from operator to operator, and from aircraft to aircraft, manufacturer to manufacturer, etc. The two types of maintenance are \"on-condition maintenance\", where each part is checked to see if maintenance is required on a regular basis; and \"hard time maintenance\", where every component is overhauled or replaced after a certain amount of time/number of cycles. We would consider this scenario to be \"on-condition maintenance\", but the examiner may well disagree with that. See the individual explanations of each option below. We can look at each option individually: \"The aircraft can be considered airworthy provided a visual inspection of the aircraft does NOT reveal technical malfunctions. This is referred to as condition monitoring.\" Reported as incorrect. What this option describes is effectively a pre-flight check, as the person undertaking the inspection is not identified, and the pilot must do this before every flight anyway, and therefore does not include the fact that the aircraft has been parked for a while. \"The airworthiness maintenance statement could also contain a due date for hard-time maintenance after a certain number of cycles.\" This option is phrased very badly, but at the moment it is our best guess at the correct answer. It is all quite true, and some items are not expected to wear whilst the aircraft is parked, etc., but the words \"due date\" are misleading as how can it be known when an aircraft will complete that many cycles in the future? We think that maybe the examiner has not considered this phrasing, and means due date as a fixed number of cycles, not an actual date. \"After each parking period, irrespective of the duration, the airworthiness maintenance statement will need to be revised. This is an example of a hard-time maintenance method.\" Reported as incorrect. This answer has flaws. The engineers will revise the airworthiness maintenance statement by performing an inspection and testing when the aircraft is coming back to service after being parked. We would, however, argue that this is not an example of hard time maintenance, which is the flaw in this option. \"The maintenance statement remains always valid up to the flight time limits provided.\" No, the aircraft must certainly be checked over after a period of being parked, as per the main explanation above.",

If you have any further exam feedback against this question, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft enters a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular, an increased load (stress) on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain.",

Redundancy is another word for additional, or duplicate, and means that there is not just one load path or one source for any system. Essentially, to provide the correct amount of safety in the case of a failure under the \"fail-safe\" design concept, there needs to be another option to stop a catastrophic event occurring. For structural items, this is usually multiple load paths, so that if one breaks, the other can take the required forces without fully breaking. For systems, there are usually extra sources (electrical power, hydraulic pressure, etc.) to stop a complete failure of the more essential systems, such as flight controls or landing gear extension.",

Sometimes this is by literally breaking down the composition of the other substance, which is the most dramatic form of corrosion. This happens when one of the substances is corrosive to the other one. For instance, Mercury is HIGHLY corrosive to aluminium, and burns straight through aluminium if the two come into contact (also producing toxic fumes; they really are not a very pleasant combination). To address the options in this question: Mercury is corrosive (to aluminium and a few other metals particularly) as stated earlier. Battery Acid is corrosive also. It is quite easy to remember this one, for obvious reasons. Fuel is not corrosive, which is very useful for storage (but it can allow the breeding of bacteria that can be corrosive to metal fuel tanks). Hydraulic Fluid is annoyingly complex when it comes to corrosiveness. One of the favourable properties of a good hydraulic fluid is for it to be non-corrosive. This is the case when it is in contact with metal, but it can be corrosive to paintwork, certain types of rubber seals, etc. Water is corrosive due to oxidisation, which causes rust. It is not highly corrosive, but the air contained within water will slowly break down materials like unprotected metals. Toilet Waste is a mixture of water (corrosive) and ammonia, as well as bacteria, all of which are corrosive to various materials",

Mercury is the only metal element which is liquid at room temperature. Over the last few centuries, it has had many uses, from measuring pressure, to temperature, and more. It is, however, toxic, and produces a gas which is toxic to humans over time, and before that can cause brain chemistry changes leading insanity (there is an interesting story about the origin of the phrase \"as mad as a hatter\" from the 17th century, if you look it up). It also reacts very strongly with aluminium, which corrodes the aluminium very rapidly, and is the reason that mercury thermometers are not longer allowed on aircraft, as any spillage could corrode a hole through the fuselage, which is primarily made of aluminium on most aircraft. The only other close option here would be pottasium hydroxide, which can be corrosive to many metals, including aluminium, but not at nearly the same rate as mercury. It also does not produce toxic fumes, but is hazardous to the skin if it comes in contact. It is the electrolyte used in a few different battery types, but not really part of the syllabus, so we do not need to know anything about it, and therefore it is not the correct answer. The other options are both substances that are contained by metal, so are certainly not corrosive to it.",

            "explanation": "Operators must follow a constant cycle of cleaning, inspection, operational preservation, and lubrication to prevent corrosion. Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment. Therefore, the close proximity of the base to the sea will likely mean increased corrosion, and therefore some regular washing and covering up of the engines is not a bad idea from the operator. The whole aircraft being washed would be a bit better, but as this could be very time consuming, so just washing the sensitive landing gear might be a better compromise. The aircraft maintenance manual does not need to include a requirement to clean and cover up the aircraft, and it is common for every aircraft to be cleaned and covered up from time to time.",

This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as turbulence, excessive vibration, or high loads during takeoff or landing. Over time, the stress can cause the material to weaken, which can lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed. The above image was apparently the result of a hard landing, which makes sense as it is around the main gear. Paint wear and bulges, impact dents and scratches, and faded paintwork may all be cosmetic issues that do not necessarily indicate stress on the airframe. While impact dents may cause localized stress, they do not necessarily indicate continuous stress on the entire airframe. It is important to regularly inspect the aircraft for signs of stress and take appropriate maintenance and repair actions to ensure safe and reliable operation.",

This question and the available options are quite ridiculous. We believe that the wing root fairings are probably most correct, as they cover the wing root, the highest stress point on the aircraft, and any deformation (due to high stress) would cause cracking, which may be visible on the fairing. However, it appears that most authorities are considering the \"wing root fairings\" to be incorrect (Spain and Poland confirmed). We think the next best answer is the \"aft pressure bulkhead\", but that is unconfirmed. Please send us any further exam feedback you have and let us know which authority you sat with, thank you! We obviously agree that a thorough inspection of the tail skid is important, as this is where evidence of tailstrikes would show, but we find the wording a little incongruous. We cannot inspect the aft pressure bulkhead itself - which is the area prone to stress due to pressurisation - as it is inside the aircraft skin, and the tail-skid itself is not naturally prone to stress (other than damage from tailstrikes). Furthermore, if the aft pressure bulkhead is considered correct, surely the forward pressure bulkhead must be correct also, in the fact that it cannot be inspected directly (as it is internal), but the outer skin can be inspected and is also prone to damage (birdstrikes). Therefore, we find it very unclear what the examiner is really asking here. Realistically, the exam wording makes quite a big difference to the question also. If the question does not include \"prone to stress\", then the argument is very different, as well as if different options are present. Neither the question nor the options have been verified as having the exact wording. We therefore need as much feedback for this one as we can get, thank you!

It should enable them to have adequate visibility in the forward, upward, and downward directions, while still being able to view all the instruments in the cockpit. To optimize the pilots' vision through the windows, certain aircraft are equipped with an eye reference position indicator. This indicator helps ensure that pilots' eye positions are optimized for the best possible view. In the absence of such indicators, aircraft often rely on a recommended view, which suggests how to position the pilots' line of sight to effectively see the glareshield. See some examples below: THE EYE REFERENCE POINT (figure 1) Fixed markers or other guides are installed at each pilot station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. The Eye Reference Position standardises the visual attitude especially on approach and landing. THE EYE REFERENCE INDICATOR (figure 2) Some modern transport aircraft provide an eye reference indicator on the centre structure of the windshield. The indicator is a device that is fitted with 3 balls painted red or white. To achieve a correct seating position, pilots must align the red and white ball meaning that the white ball is hidden when in the correct position. OPTIMISED FIELD OF VIEW (figure 3) The cockpit is designed so that when the pilot has aligned themselves to the eye reference point; all of the instruments and displays on the front panel are in their field of view.

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

However many of the latest aircraft make use of modern composites for the empennage, cabin floor panels, flying control surfaces, engine cowlings and fairings. Each material is chosen for its particular properties with regard to fatigue strength, wear resistance, strength to weight ratio, fire resistance etc. COMPOSITE MATERIALS Composite materials are made of at least two elements to produce a material with properties that are different to those of the original elements. Nearly all composites consist of a bulk material, this is called the matrix and some form of reinforcement. This reinforcement is used mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix and is usually in a fibre form. ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - The ability to arrange the fibres to obtain directional properties consistent with the load - The ability to make complex shapes, since the material is not homogeneous - Weight savings - Resistance to corrosion - High specific strength - High specific stiffness DISADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - They are quickly eroded by hail, sand, etc, so leading edges must be sheathed. - They are difficult to repair. - They can absorb moisture if the material is not correctly sealed. When comparing composite and metal structures, composite are: - Lighter: Composites can be up to 70 percent lighter than metal. - High strength-to-weight ratio: composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber weighs about 25% as much as steel and 70% as much as aluminum, and is much stronger and stiffer than both materials per weight. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. - Stronger: When increasing the strength of metal, it must be equally strong in all directions thickening the material and causing an increase in weight. Composites however can be engineered and designed to be strong in a specific direction while keeping it lightweight. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. - Corrosion Resistant: Composites resist weather damage and other harsh chemicals that would typically damage metal. - Nonconductive: Unlike steel, composites are nonconductive.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. Glass is not quite as good for aircraft windshields, and even though there may be some form of glass within the many layers, the heating would not affect its properties to the same scale as the vinyl, and the glass has different properties anyway. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

            "explanation": "Note: this does delve into priciples of flight a little, but is still within AGK enough to be acceptable. Learning Objective 021.02.03.01.01: Describe the following types of design and explain their advantages and disadvantages: high-mounted wing; low-mounted wing; low- or mid-set tailplane; T-tail. There are two main places that an aircraft designer can mount a horizontal stabiliser at the rear of an aircraft. One place is \"low mounted\", at the base of the tail fin, and the other place is at the top of the fin, a \"T-tail\" due to its shape looking like the letter \"T\". The low-mounted position tends to be more common on large civilian transport aircraft these days, but both mounting locations have their own positive and negative factors. We will now talk about T-tail in comparison to low-mounted. T-tails have the horizontal stabiliser up and away from the turbulence created by the wing (during normal flight), which means the airflow over the tailplane is smoother. As the tailplane is therefore less affected by the downwash from the main wing, we can refer to this mounting position as \"stabilising\" (some questions in PoF ask about this). T-tails also make the fin and rudder more effective, as they act as a winglet for the fin and rudder, so a smaller rudder is required. However, all the forces produced by the horizontal stabiliser and the elevators must travel through the fin, meaning that the fin must be made much stronger (and therefore heavier) than if the stabiliser was mounted on the fuselage at the bottom. Also, a more practical consideration is that inspection is more difficult, especially when it comes to icing/de-icing. The final consideration for a T-tail is probably the most well known. The horizontal stabiliser may be out of the way of the turbulence from the wing during normal flight, but at high angles of attack, the tailplane will now be within the stalled region behind the wing, leading to a stall where no elevator control is possible, called a deep-stall. Deep-stalls can sometimes be unrecoverable. So let's go through the options. \"It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. It has a stabilising effect on the aircraft, so decreases manoeuvrability. It is not simpler to design, requiring a very strong fin. It is obviously harder to inspect though, that bit is correct. \"It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics, but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness at high angles of attack.\" Correct, as mentioned above, the smoother airflow is correct, the stronger, heavier fin is also correct, and the last section which refers to a deep-stall at high angles of attack is correct as well for a T-tail. \"It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. Ground clearance is debatable, as an aircraft's wings are usually more of a concern for that. It is not simpler to design, as it requires a stronger fin. The last section about de-icing is correct, though. \"It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics, it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier fin.\" Incorrect. Smoother airflow, yes; but it certainly does not have a wider operating range in pitch, as it suffers from deep-stalls, becoming useless at high angles of attack. It does require a heavier fin though.",

Flutter is caused by the interaction of aerodynamic forces, inertia forces and the elastic properties of the surface or structure and can lead to the catastrophic failure of the structure. An aircraft that is in the cruise will be supported by its wings and they will be bent upwards. If the aircraft is subjected to a gust it will shake up and down with the wings flapping at a certain frequency. If the vibration is similar to that of the structure of the wing then it will begin to resonate. The resonance will amplify the flutter and may well lead to failure of the structure. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope of the aircraft. Flutter can be prevented by mass balancing control surfaces to alter the moment of inertia of the surface and therefore the period of vibration (move the control surface C of G from behind the hinge to closer to the hinge). Poorly maintained aircraft, particularly those with excessive control surface backlash (play) or flexibility may mean that flutter could occur at speeds below the limit airspeed.",

Cross section 3 => depicts a double bubble sort of fuselage which is second most suitable because forces are almost distributed equally over the fuselage. These kinds are often used because of the space it can provide for passengers or cargo. Cross section 4 => represents largely one circle which is inturrupted by another shape. In this case, forces are distributed better than in a squared fuselage, however, it is not as strong as a double bubble construction. Correct sequence: 2, 3, 4, 1 (decreasing stability)",

When a aircraft is stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. This effect is increased with any increased weight of the wing, engines fitted or fuel inside the wings. The effect is reversed when flying in straight and level (1g) flight, where the wings are supending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. This effect is increased when the lift increases (larger all-up weight, higher load factor, etc.) and also when the fuel in the wings is less, and there would be less weight resistance to the upwards flexing effect. The wing flex of different scenarios can be seen in the annex depicting a B52.",

            "explanation": "An airframe is the combination of the whole structure of an aircraft. It undergoes many forces during flight, the largest being the lifting force from the wings. Whatever the weight of the aircraft, the wings have to be able to suspend that amount of force with lift, and the vast majority of that force goes through the two wing roots. Hence, they are usually the strongest place on the entire aircraft. A very high stress scenario for the aircraft is pulling any sort of G-force, which requires increasing the load factor of the wings, and that means the lift of the wing has to increase. Large transport aircraft (CS-25) have a \"limit load factor\" of 2.5 G, and must be able to pull 150% of this (3.75 G) before complete structural failure occurs. This means that an aircraft will have to show during testing that the structure (mostly the wing spar and wing root) can withstand a lifting force of 3.75 times its own maximum take-off weight, which can be an incredible amount of force, before failing. Any G-force over the limit load factor is an \"overload\". An aircraft increases its loading during manoeuvres, so in banked turns (the greater the bank, the higher the wing loading), and any abrupt changes in direction, pitch, etc. Also, the loading increases in turbulence and any windshear. Aircraft stress obviously increases with weight, but the limiting load factor is set for the MTOW, so it can only get better as the aircraft gets lighter. VA is the manoeuvring speed, and if flying below VA, the aircraft will be unable to pull its limit load factor during a manoeuvre, as it will stall first, and therefore will not overload the airframe. Headwinds and tailwinds do not affect loading, as the aircraft just flies through the air mass it is in, and the head/tailwinds simply move the air mass forwards or backwards, increasing or decreasing groundspeed. As long as the winds do not change rapidly (windshear), this should not affect aircraft loading.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

If the hole was in the passenger cabin, then the cargo hold high pressure would push up on the floor, again causing it to buckle.

            "explanation": "Ensuring accurate calculation of take-off performance data is crucial for reducing the chance of a tail strike during take-off. Knowing the correct rotation speed allows pilots to smoothly lift the aircraft's nose at the right moment. If the rotation speed is too high, it can lead to an excessively steep climb angle, increasing the likelihood of a tail strike as the aircraft leaves the ground. Conversely, if the rotation speed is too low, the aircraft may not achieve the desired pitch attitude for liftoff, potentially causing a tail strike as well. The two major threats for tail strikes to occur are during the landing flare/touchdown and during rotation on take-off. As many large jet transport aircraft are extended in length for larger passenger numbers, the long tail leaves very little tail margin during rotation, and factors such as crosswinds, gusty head/tailwinds and different weight and CG locations can lead to the potential for reduced tail clearance or tail strike. To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

Materials all have different properties, such as their strength, elasticity, resistance to corrosion, weight, cost, heat resistance, etc. The material that is chosen for the vast majority of aircraft construction is usually metal (composites are becoming more widely used in the sector, but metal is still the bulk of the industry). Different metals have different levels of strength, they are different to work with, and are used in different sections of the aircraft. For instance, the fuselage is usually made from an easily manufactured aluminium alloy, but sections of the hot engine are made from the very expensive, but incredibly heat resistant titanium. Alloys are a clever way of combining the different properties of two or more metals to make them better for the required usage. Now to answer this question. In general, metal has a high strength to weight ratio (in that it is strong but also light). The only better type of material for strength to weight ratio is composites. Composites such as carbon fibre, aramid (Kevlar), fibreglass, and plastic composites can be made incredibly strong, but far lighter than metals. Their fibres can also be aligned to create strength in particular directions, which is much harder to do in metal. The answer is not composites though, because they are very resistant to corrosion. Metal, however, is highly susceptible to corrosion, and it is a large part of what engineers check for and treat when they maintain an aircraft.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. Heating elements are added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. The heating elements usually heat the windows into this temperature range, switch off so they do not overheat, then switch back on again if the window is going to cool down too much, cycling like this throughout every flight. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly that restriction is to be not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

Strength-to-weight ratio is an important factor, as materials with a high strength-to-weight ratio are either stronger or lighter than other materials, both of which are useful for aviation. This is why metal and composites are so commonly used for aircraft construction, due to their high strength-to-weight ratios. As for the other options, susceptibility to corrosion is bad as it will weaken the airframe and potentially lead to failure.

Corrosion is unlikely to remove rivets on its own, as they are fused to the skin, and corrosion would have to be incredibly severe (and therefore noticeable) to start removing them completely. Hard landings and high manoeuvring loads can remove rivets, screws, and other fasteners through shearing forces, for example, if the \"improper maintenance or installation\" option is not present in the exam, this option should be chosen. With the options as they are, hard landing and manoeuvring loads are less likely to cause the complete loss of rivets than improper maintenance or installation.

The layering of different materials help to provide better impact resistance than one type of material only, combining the best features of all the materials.

The appropriate action to take if an operator notices corrosion on metal parts of their aircraft fleet is to repair, prime, and paint the damaged parts. This is important because corrosion can weaken the metal and compromise the structural integrity of the aircraft, which can be a safety hazard. Replacing the metal parts with plastic or composite materials may be an option, but it can be expensive and may not always be feasible. It is also important to note that different materials have different properties, and they may not be suitable for all applications. Washing the aircraft thoroughly after each flight may be important for general maintenance but may not prevent corrosion. A notable point is that washing the aircraft after every flight could cause some water based corrosion or rusting over time, so is not a good idea to fight corrosion. Painting over the corrosion to protect the area and add strength is not a recommended practice as it does not address the underlying corrosion issue and can lead to further damage. Therefore, the best course of action is to have the affected parts assessed by a qualified technician and have the corrosion removed and repaired, and then properly primed and painted to protect against further corrosion.",

Therefore, the doors in a pressurised aeroplane have to be specifically designed to seal to the frame and not break or buckle under the forces of pressurisation. This is why pressurised aircraft often use \"plug type\" doors, where the door is larger than the frame, and is mounted inside of the frame, so the door is being pushed into the door frame by the force of air pressure, acting like a \"plug\" for the hole. These doors have to be opened inwards into the aircraft, and then are usually hinged in such a way that they can go back through the door frame sideways and remain outside the aircraft whilst open. This is done primarily to reduce the space taken up inside the aircraft by the door, which also helps during an evacuation. Therefore, the most correct answer is that the door can move inside and outside the aircraft. As for the other options; They are not always used in unpressurised aircraft, in fact I imagine that is quite rare. They do not need a pressure relief valve, they are supposed to hold quite high pressure loads, and there will be an over-pressure relief valve somewhere on the aircraft fuselage.

They are only opened and closed on the ground, of course, so primarily this will be done with the electric hydraulic pumps providing the pressure to the system. However, if the electric hydraulic pumps are not operating (electric supply issues or pumps INOP), then the cargo doors can be opened and closed using a hand pump to provide the necessary pressure to the hydraulics. As for the other options: Engine driven pumps require the engines to be on, and that would be very hazardous for ground crew trying to open the cargo doors, so is not feasible. A ram air turbine is a small wind turbine that drops from the underside of an aircraft to provide power/hydraulic pressure to important controls in flight. It is not used on the ground, nor would it be useful without any airflow through it. A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc.",

Whilst this is an awful question, which pilots would usually have no business dealing with, it can still be worked out with the normal knowledge from the syllabus. A hydraulic accumulator is a device used to store hydraulic pressure, for the purposes of smoothing out hydraulic pressure changes, and storing the pressure in case there is a loss of hydraulic pump, so a finite amount of pressure remains for further uses. It works by compressing nitrogen inside the accumulator with the force of the hydraulic fluid, and then the high pressure nitrogen is where the energy is stored. There are a few different ways to do this, via diaphragm, with a moving piston between the fluid and the nitrogen, and with no separation at all, just gravity. These are the types of gas charged accumulators, but there are also spring accumulators and even weighted accumulators that can be used. We do not normally look into these though. If an accumulator was mounted horizontally, the gravity option would not keep the fluid in the lines, so would not work. Therefore only a diaphragm or (more likely) a moving piston would be used in this orientation. This should mean that there is no cross-contamination of nitrogen and hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid stays on one side of the piston/diaphragm, the nitrogen stays on the other side. If, as in this scenario, there is an amount of hydraulic fluid leaving the nitrogen release valve, then there must have been some sort of leak between the two, for hydraulic fluid to enter the nitrogen section.",

In this case, hydraulic pressure is a gauge pressure, and is therefore measured against atmospheric pressure. We can also work this out by thinking about what happens when you de-pressurise a hydraulic system completely. The hydraulic pressure will read 0 PSI, as the fluid is exerting the same amount of pressure on its surroundings as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric pressure is around 14.7 PSI greater than a vacuum (i.e. its absolute pressure is 14.7 PSI, or 1013 hPa). For instance, manifold pressure gauges read out MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure), so show the absolute ambient pressure when the engine is off. Other systems rarely read out absolute pressure.",

            "explanation": "A \"swash plate pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump, also called a \"demand pump\". This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. Note: The wording is unconfirmed on this question as it came from limited feedback, but we don't expect any significant differences to the real exam, certainly nothing that will change the answer.",

When flow stops, the spring pushes the ball against the seat which prevents fluid from flowing in the opposite direction through the valve. An arrow on the outside of the housing indicated the direction in which fluid flow is permitted.",

On its own it is not useful as it has varying pressure output, which could perhaps overpressure a system or burn out the pump motor, etc., so it has to be combined with an automatic cut-out valve (ACOV) which turns this constant voulme output into a constant pressure supply into a system. There are quite a few different ways of creating a constant delivery pump, primarily for the ATPLs we usually think of a gear style pump for this purpose, but for context we have attached an image that shows some possible pump designs. Bear in mind that constant pressure pumps have less options for how they can be constructed (usually an axial piston pump design with a control piston).",

Hydraulic Accumulators are usually installed in hydraulic systems to store energy, in the form of hydraulic fluid under pressure (which will allow limited operation of hydraulic services when the pump is not operating or in case of an emergency) and to dampen out pressure fluctuations within the system. They are often used after a pump in a hydraulic system to do both these jobs, and by doing so increase efficiency and reduce the stresses on the hydraulic system. They can use a diaphragm or a movable piston, with one side connected to the hydraulic lines and containing hydraulic fluid, but with the other side filled with gas (usually nitrogen), which can compress to the same pressure as the system. For instance, in the event of pump failures, the hydraulic accumulator would allow the brakes to be applied a limited number of times.",

In simple words, a hydraulic system is used to drive machinery or move mechanical components using a fluid under pressure. The aircraft hydraulics are used on aircraft of all sizes to operate most of their equipment, such as landing gears, brakes, flaps, thrust reversers, and flight controls. Thus, the hydraulic system performs the function of moving and actuating the critical and the basic components. The working principle of hydraulic systems is based on the Pascal’s law of pressure transmission. Flight control surfaces and landing gear mechanisms are operated using this principle, by exerting a force on the hydraulic fluid by a piston. The fluid then actuates an output mechanism to operate mechanical components.",

On some large aircraft (such as the Airbus A320 family), the cargo doors are very heavy and are therefore lifted by hydraulics. They are only opened and closed on the ground, of course, so primarily this will be done with the electric hydraulic pumps providing the pressure to the system. However, if the electric hydraulic pumps are not operating (electric supply issues or pumps INOP), then the cargo doors can be opened and closed using a hand pump to provide the necessary pressure to the hydraulics. As for the other options: A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc. Power transfer units are used to transfer hydraulic pressure (not fluid) from one system to another, but one system has to be pressurised for this to work, and that is not the case in this scenario. External hydraulic power units do not exist for this kind of scenario. That is a fake option, playing on the fact that external air carts and external ground power units can feed the aircraft pneumatic systems and electrical systems, but not hydraulics.",

This process will purify the hydraulic fluid and protect the system from damages created by the particle contents. Some filters are equipped with a contamination indicator. As contaminating particles collect on the filter element, the differential pressure across the element increases. For pop-up indicators, when the increase in pressure reaches a specific value, an indicator (usually in the filter head) pops out, signifying an impending filter by-pass - the filter must be cleaned or replaced. At this point, the filter is still able to filter the fluid, however it is likely to become fully blocked/clogged soon.",

Nowadays, most large passenger aircraft have braking redundancy which is achieved by multiple, independent hydraulic systems backed up by accumulators. These systems allow for several layers of failure without resulting in total loss of braking capability. In most cases, the right hydraulic system supplies the normal brakes. If this is lost, there is an automatic switchover to Alternate Brakes powered by the center system. In addition to supply system redundancy, the brake accumulator is also an emergency source of power for the brakes in many power brake systems.

Only the simplest hydraulic systems, such as the brake circuit on a light aircraft, are powered by human effort. All advanced hydraulic systems use some form of pump to increase hydraulic pressure and facilitate fluid flow under pressure. Hydraulic systems can be classified as either: Low-pressure systems: Typically operating up to 2000 PSI. High-pressure systems: Typically operating at 3000 PSI, though some aircraft may use hydraulic pressures of 4000 to 5000 PSI. High pressure reduces fluid volume and component mass. However, even at higher pressures, hydraulic fluid is considered incompressible. Very high pressures can induce shear stresses in the fluid, leading to adverse hydraulic effects. Additionally, there is a slightly increased risk of fluid leaks at joints in the lines. Properties High Pressure Low Pressure Weight (similar size aircraft) Lighter due to smaller actuators Higher Force Able to apply extremely large forces Unable to apply larger forces Construction Complex Simple Pressure Yes No",

            "explanation": "A \"demand pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump. This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It runs at a constant RPM and modulates its volumetric flow output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. In terms of hydraulic pressures, most large transport aircraft have hydraulic pressures in the range of 3000 - 5000 psi as this is a good amount to power heavy control surfaces and landing gear systems, etc. Larger aircraft tend to have higher pressures in general, and the Airbus A380 runs hydraulic pressures of 5000 psi, whereas Boeing 737s run at 3000 psi.",

Hydraulic fluids are also \"irritating to skin and eyes\" according to the Learning Objectives. This is another reason that we believe that the corrosion answer is most correct. The internal workings of the hydraulic system will be metal, perhaps with special coatings, but certainly not paint. The aircraft is covered with paint though, and anyone who has carelessly bled brakes before will know that brake fluid (hydraulic fluid) is corrosive to paintwork. Whether it will harm the bodywork underneath would depend on the material and the individual fluid. Whilst it should have good anti-corrosion properties, who knows how good those are, especially against different materials. Important Note: We have received conflicting feedback about this question. Any further exam feedback would therefore be very useful to help us verify this question, and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or placed in the comments.

This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure.",

An accumulator is fitted to store hydraulic fluid under pressure, dampen hydraulic pressure fluctuations, allow for thermal expansion and provide an emergency supply of hydraulic fluid under pressure to the system in the event of a pump failure. The gas side of the accumulator is charged to a predetermined pressure with air or nitrogen. As the accumulator is fitted and the hydraulic pressure in the system builds up, the gas in the accumulator will be compressed until fluid and gas pressures equalise at normal system pressure. That is why the accumulator gauge will read the same as the hydraulic system is pressurised to. The correct answer mentions that it provides \"hydraulic power\" in the event of a system failure or emergency, which is correct, as the gas is compressed to store energy which keeps the fluid pressurised in order to provide power onto hydraulic actuators if the pumps fail. This is often used for things such as brake applications in the event of a complete hydraulic failure.",

The cylinder and the drive-shaft are coaxial and rotate taking the pistons which can move up and down in the cylinder. The pistons are a connected to shoes to the non-rotating yoke or swash plate. The angle of the swash-plate and thus the piston stroke is varied by the position of the control piston. This piston is controlled by the outlet pressure on one side of it and a spring on the other. If the pump is stationary there will be no hydraulic pressure and so the spring will push the control piston to the right and the swash-plate angle will be maximum. As the pump begins to rotate the pistons will start moving up and down because of the angle of the swash-plate. If the required operating pressure is reached, the control piston will be pushed back to the left causing the swash-plate to be almost vertical and therefore the pistons’ stroke will be minimal. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 2 shows the pump at maximum stroke and picture 3 shows the pump at minimum stroke.",

Larger aircraft with multiple main gear wheels often mount the main landing gear on bogie beams, which are excellent for absorbing direct impacts during landing, but can suffer from very high sideways loads during tight turns whilst taxiing. These sideways loads also put a lot of sideways stress on the tyres, which can only rotate forwards and backwards, of course, so will get unnecessarily \"scrubbed\" during tight turns. This effect can be reduced somewhat by giving the main gear bogie beams a small amount of available steering angle, which is only used in slow speed tight turns, turning the opposite direction of the nose wheel to turn sideways forces into longitudinal forces on the main gear assemblies, thereby reducing stress on the torsional links and reducing tyre abrasion. This also has the added benefit of reducing the turning circle radius of such large aircraft, such as the Boeing B777.",

INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will result in a longer stopping distance on dry runways only. INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never ensure the required stopping distance – take-off has to be avoided. INCORRECT, while manual braking significantly increases the braking distance (50%) this doesn’t mean the stopping distance available isn’t long enough. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. Manual braking When the anti-skid is inoperative the braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never be as consistent and efficient as the auto-brake with anti-skid would.",

The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

Please do let us know if you see this question in the real exam and anything you can remember about it, thank you. Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.06: Describe the various protection devices to avoid inadvertent gear retraction on the ground and explain the implications of taking off with one or more protection devices in place: ground lock (pins); protection devices in the gear retraction mechanism. Let's go through the options: \"Insert the ground lock pins.\" Correct. Ground lock pins are for the landing gear when an aircraft has a retractable undercarriage, and they slot into the gear downlock system to make sure that the gear cannot retract whilst on the ground, no matter what happens to the hydraulics or external conditions. For long term storage, they must be fitted. They are part of the pilot's checks before flight, also, as leaving them in will not allow the landing gear to be raised. \"Leave the parking brakes on.\" Incorrect. The parking brakes of an aircraft are just sealed off hydraulic fluid, and leaving them on for extended periods of time can lead to seizing of the brakes, or potentially a leak of the hydraulic fluid through small imperfections in the system, allowing the brakes to gradually release. Aircraft are chocked or tied down for long term storage. \"Leave the flaps in the extended position to release the hydraulic pressure.\" Incorrect. Flaps should be up for long term storage, to avoid wind damage, damage to the mechanism, keep birds from nesting in the flap tracks, etc. The hydraulic pressure has nothing to do with it. \"Always park the aircraft facing upwind.\" Whilst this is best practice, it cannot always be done, and even if you park into wind one day, for long periods of parking, the wind will change and the aircraft will no longer be into wind all the time.",

Any deep cuts extending more than half the width of a rib and deeper than 50 percent of the remaining tread depth are indications for tire replacement. In this case, we believe the examiner is referring to superficial cuts which would make the tyre still airworthy. \"An improperly inflated tyre.\" => An under-inflated tyre will be flattened when the heavy aircraft sits on it, and parts of the shoulder which are not designed to make contact with the ground will quickly be worn.

An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

            "explanation": "Pre-flight inspections must confirm whether the condition of the tyre is suitable for operation. Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Note: If you find cuts in the tire, it’s important to make sure that they haven’t cut into the ply of the tire. Any deep cuts extending more than half the width of a rib and deeper than 50 percent of the remaining tread depth are indications for tire replacement. In this case, we believe the examiner is referring to superficial cuts which would make the tyre still airworthy. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. Such system allows the landing gear to just drop naturally under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversible operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through a mechanical linkage. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. The weight of the gear will also push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical downlocks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. There are other systems available for emergency gear extension, such as electrical or pneumatic, but gravity free-fall is so much more common due to its simplicity and lack of potential failure points. It is often aided by pneumatic pressure or a similar system to release the uplocks though.",

As previously discussed, RTO does NOT provide a predetermined fixed braking force. Instead, it always ensures the maximum available braking power. “Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft.” INCORRECT. As discussed, the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft is by using the autobrakes which will reduce the pilot’s workload and allow them to focus on other tasks, i.e. directional control. “Without pilot input, the RTO mode will automatically brake the aircraft to a full stop.” This one is ambiguous and unfortunately, we have to assume that the pilot has not yet taken the decision to abort take off – meaning that he hasn’t retarded the power levers. As you know, in order to activate the RTO mode, some conditions must be met - One of those conditions is that the pilot has to bring the power levers to the idle position. Only then the RTO will brake the aircraft to a full stop. Even though, this statement isn’t completely wrong, it isn’t completely accurate either.",

An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

On the majority of cars, this means the force you apply to the brake pedal pressurises the brake fluid (hydraulic fluid), and this pressure is used to push a piston (actuator) to force brake pads (stators) into brake discs (rotors) connected to each wheel. The harder you push the pedal, the harder the brake pads contact the discs, the more friction is caused, and the harder you decelerate. This is a manual braking system. In light aircraft, the same system is present, but in large aircraft, many thousands of times more braking force is needed, requiring large multi-disk brakes on many more wheels, and your feet are just not able to provide enough force to apply these brakes, no matter how much you go to the gym. This means that the brakes run off the normal hydraulic system, and your feet (or the autobrake - if fitted) are now simply moving a valve to provide more or less hydraulic pressure to the brake actuators. This means that, given large aircraft hydraulic systems can run from 3000 to 5000 psi, these can provide much more braking force, and the power comes from hydraulic pumps, not your feet. PARKING BRAKES Parking brakes operate the same in almost all aircraft, no matter whether you are using manual brakes or a hydraulically assisted system. They use a simple shut-off valve upstream of the brake actuators, and whilst the brakes are being applied, with the pads pushed into the disks, the valve is closed to trap that hydraulic pressure inside the braking system and keep those wheels stopped. The only difference is how much pressure is trapped within the brakes when you set it on. In a light aircraft, you need to push the brakes hard enough when setting the parking brake, or they might not be fully set on. Most large aircraft will not let you make this mistake. If you do leave parking brakes set on for a long time, small leaks within the system may slowly allow the pressure to drop and the brakes might slowly release, or the brakes could go the other way and seize in place, so aircraft should not have them set for too long, and instead chocks and tie-downs should be used to secure aircraft for long periods.",

Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. This is not the case for the RTO mode though. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. This mode uses maximum braking, which will either be limited by the anti-skid system on poor traction surfaces, tyre limitations, or by the maximum brake pressure. The use of reverse thrust is beneficial for stopping distance, but in RTO mode the autobrake will continue to apply maximum braking until disarmed or stopped, irrespective of the deceleration rate. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. Otherwise, the autobrake will stop the aircraft completely.",

The most common kinds you will see are the hand crank, hand pump hydraulic, free fall and pressurized nitrogen bottle systems. These systems are designed for emergency gear extension - not retraction. Failure of gear to retract is not an emergency unless it retracts partially and cannot be extended again A hand crank system is often found on aeroplanes with electric gear systems. The crank is employed to turn the gears that operate the actuators manually instead of through the electric motor. If you fly an aeroplane with a hydraulic system, you might use a hydraulic hand pump system to extend the gear when the primary pump fails. You do so by supplying the necessary hydraulic fluid pressure to the actuator cylinders by pumping a hand pump. A freefall system is another method of gear extension used on aeroplanes that have hydraulic gear systems. A control lever is used to open a valve that releases the system pressure. Hydraulic pressure equalizes on both sides of the gear actuators and allow the landing gear to fall into position through the force of gravity and aerodynamic loads. In the pressurized nitrogen bottle system, the nitrogen is not directly used to actuate the landing gear actuators or brake units but, instead, it applies the pressurized nitrogen to move hydraulic fluid to the actuator.",

The landing gear anti-retract pin is a safety device used in aircraft. This pin is inserted into the landing gear mechanism during ground operations, typically as part of the aircraft's parking procedures, maintenance, or pre-flight checks. The primary function of the landing gear anti-retract pin is to prevent the landing gear from retracting while the aircraft is on the ground. If the pin is left in place, it will continue to perform this function after takeoff, preventing the landing gear from retracting. This would lead to an inability to stow the landing gear, resulting in increased drag and fuel consumption, and potentially impacting the flight's safety and efficiency.",

            "explanation": "“In the RTO mode the auto-brake system provides a fixed level of deceleration.” INCORRECT. If certain conditions are met, the RTO autobrake setting commands maximum braking pressure/power. Therefore, it does not provide a predetermined fixed braking force. “Manual braking is always the best stopping technique for a rejected take-off.” INCORRECT. Especially when conditions are less than ideal (shorter and wet runways), or rejected take off, many flight crews prefer to use the autobrake rather than use manual braking, and devote their attention to the use of rudder for directional control => “the machine does the braking and I maintain directional control”. Autobrake reduces pilots’ workload and allows them to channel their attention to other important duties. Furthermore, with autobrake, the human’s reaction time on pressing the brakes is eliminated – therefore, it is more efficient. “When the RTO mode is armed, the system will operate at any speed when the take-off is aborted.” INCORRECT. The wheel speed must be at least (around) 90 kts and the thrust levers must be moved to idle position. In case of an aborted take off below wheel speed of 90 kts, the autobrake system will not activate. “Without pilot interference an auto-brake system continues to operate until standstill.” CORRECT. Unless the system is disarmed by flight crew pressing the pushbutton switch or applying enough deflection to at least one brake pedal – the autobrake will bring the aircraft to a complete stop.",
