The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. For this question, we will consider the take-off and landing situations, subtracting from the Maximum Permissible Take-off Mass and the Performance Limited Landing Mass limits the OM, the TL and the fuel masses (as required), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: Max TOM - OM - TL = 6400 - 4480 - 1870 = + 50 kg. Max LM - (OM- Trip fuel) - TL = 5430 - (4480-1090) - 1870 = + 170 kg. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and the \"+\" sign indicates that it is underloaded by 50 kg. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Regarding this question, it's worth noting that all the options are given in kilograms. Additionally, the question provides a fuel density of 0.8, which means we can't directly utilize the \"kg\" data from the provided figure. Instead, we need to calculate the total usable fuel in liters and then apply the fuel density (x 0.8). Assuming the pilot decides to refuel only the wing tanks, both inner and outer, for the aforementioned purposes, the total available fuel on-board will be: [(Outer tanks x 2) + (Inner tanks x 2)] x 0.8 = [(880 ltr x 2) + (6 924 ltr x 2)] x 0.8 = 12 486 kg",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: It appears that in the official exam, a table will be provided, indicating the necessary stabilizer trim settings for various configurations (flaps 5 and flaps 15) and different CG %MAC values. However, since we don't have access to the official annex, we have included the relevant information directly in the question text. The stabilizer trim is carefully adjusted to provide just the right level of assistance during rotation. When the center of gravity (CG) is situated forward, resulting in the aircraft being nose-heavy, it necessitates more assistance from the stabilizer trim. Conversely, if the CG is positioned toward the rear, there is already a natural tendency for the nose to pitch up (tail-heavy), resulting in a reduced requirement for assistance. In essence, the larger the CG number, the smaller the stabilizer trim setting number. Now, the question informs us that the CG position is at 7% of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC), which is very close to the forward limit of 6%. In such a situation, with a forward CG (nose-heavy), we would desire greater assistance from the stabilizer trim, thus indicating a high trim setting number. According to the given information, for a CG of 7% MAC, the appropriate stabilizer trim setting would be around 5 - 5.1. However, the pilots mistakenly set it to 4. This setting is more suitable for a rear CG, not the current nose-heavy condition of 7% MAC. Consequently, with this incorrect trim setting, there is insufficient assistance to handle the nose-heavy situation, leading to a longer take-off run.",

            "explanation": "In this situation fuel load is moved aft => from the wing tanks to the horizontal stabilizer. Consequently, an aft CG movement will be observed. A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. As the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since less drag needs to be overcome, less thrust will be required and fuel consumption per nautical mile will reduce. As a result, the range will be increased for an aft CG movement. Note: An Aft CG movement (tail-heavy aircraft) results in a reduced longitudinal stability.",

A flap extension creates an opposite effect. The CG reference datum is on the nose compartment of the MRJT1 aircraft. Any load/mass shifting further aft creates an additional positive moment. Conversely, any load/mass shifting further forward creates an additional negative moment. A flap extension moves a mass further aft causing an additional positive moment and, conversely, a flap retraction moves a mass further forward reducing the moment. According to the figure, with flap retraction from 40° to 0°, the moment changes by -16000 kgin and with flap retraction from 15° to 0° the moment changes by -14000 kgin. In other words, the greater the flap retraction, the greater the mass forward movement, the greater the moment reduction. Thus, a flap retraction from 40° to 15°, moves the mass forward reducing the moment by: -16000 kgin -(-14000 kgin) = -2000 kgin.",

            "explanation": "With this type of question, you will need to assume the position of the datum. The 4 answers reference both the nose wheel and also the main wheels, so for simplicity, it is suggested to use the main wheels, as this reduces the amount of calculations required. The calculations of moments and ultimately, the Centre of Gravity (CG) can be seen in the table below. The datum has been selected in line with the main wheels and all arms are using inches. The question states that the distance between the nose and main wheels is 7 ft but it is normally easier to convert to inches (7 ft = 84 inches) as calculations in feet can prove difficult. Remember: 1 foot = 12 inches. Item Mass (kg) Arm (in) Moment (kg.in) Nose wheel 285 -84 -23 940 Left main wheel 1430 0 0 Right main wheel 1430 0 0 Totals 3145 -7.6 -23 940 Therefore, the aircraft's CG position is either 7.6 in. forward of the main wheels, or 76.4 in. (84 in. - 7.6 in.) aft of the nose wheel. Further information on Moments, Arms and the Centre of Gravity: The moment is the turning force created around a datum by the mass over a distance or lever arm: Moment = Mass x Arm. Moments and arms forward of the datum are considered to be negative and those aft of the datum are positive. The Centre of Gravity (CG) can be found by adding all the moments and then dividing by the total mass: CG = Total Moment / Total Mass.",

When determining the final CG position for flight, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in the loadsheet, in the actual mass of the item and its position on the aircraft. Fuel consumption, fuel transfer, passenger movement, crew movement and configuration changes in flight need to be accounted for. Also, both the CG position and the safe envelope evolve throughout the flight. Indeed, the weight of the aircraft evolves mainly as fuel is burned. As for the CG, its position is sensitive to various phenomena ranging from landing gear, flaps and slats position to passengers or cabin crew movements from one end of the cabin to the other. To allow a margin of safety for these variations, the Certified CG limits are reduced to the operational limits, i.e. the operational CG limits are more restrictive than the certified CG limits, because error margins have been taken into account. The Operational CG limits are determined by the Operator: one for Take-off and another one for Zero-fuel. Although there were attempts at developing systems to measure the aircraft weight and CG position, no robust solution has yet been found. The best way to make sure that the CG remains within a safe envelope throughout the flight, is to both define an operational envelope that includes safety margins and to perform a correct CG calculation.",

When determining the final CG position for flight, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in the loadsheet, in the actual mass of the item and its position on the aircraft. Fuel consumption, fuel transfer, passenger movement, crew movement and configuration changes in flight need to be accounted for. Also, both the CG position and the safe envelope evolve throughout the flight. Indeed, the weight of the aircraft evolves mainly as fuel is burned. As for the CG, its position is sensitive to various phenomena ranging from landing gear, flaps and slats position to passengers or cabin crew movements from one end of the cabin to the other. To allow a margin of safety for these variations, the Certified CG limits are reduced to the operational limits, i.e. the operational CG limits are more restrictive than the certified CG limits, because error margins have been taken into account. The Operational CG limits are determined by the Operator: one for Take-off and another one for Zero-fuel. Although there were attempts at developing systems to measure the aircraft weight and CG position, no robust solution has yet been found. The best way to make sure that the CG remains within a safe envelope throughout the flight, is to both define an operational envelope that includes safety margins and to perform a correct CG calculation.",

The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on the distribution of weight in the aircraft. The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The CG of an aircraft can move but must remain within certain forward and aft limits, for reasons of both stability and control. CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall.",

The CG is along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and can be described as one point where the sum of the weight moments acting on the aircraft is zero. The fuel is fed from the tanks in the correct sequence to maintain wing bending relief and CG position. The CG position does change as fuel is burnt off, but within defined limits. If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Passenger and crew movements along the fuselage during flight are inevitable, but allowed for, resulting in CG changes. Small trim changes may be required to compensate for this movement. On most large aircraft, the main gear retracts sideways and creates no change to CG position. The nose gear can retract either forwards or backwards. As it does so, it will cause the CG to move a small amount in that direction, but is usually considered to be negligible. Any change of the tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) incidence angle does not have any effect to the CG position.",

            "explanation": "As the wing tanks fuel is consumed during flight, the CG moves aft towards the trim tank (since the fuel in the trim tank is isolated and not being burnt - resulting in a tail-heavy situation). An aircraft with forward CG is “heavier” and consequently, slower than the same aircraft with the CG further aft. For a forward CG location, a “nose-up” trim is required in most aircraft to maintain level cruising flight. Nose-up trim involves setting the tail surfaces to produce a greater down load on the aft portion of the fuselage, which adds to the wing loading and the total lift required from the wing if altitude is to be maintained. This requires a higher AOA (Angle of Attack) of the wing, which results in more drag and, in turn, increases fuel burn and reduces flight range. Furthermore, if the CG moves forward, the airplane becomes more stable. A forward CG with the increase in stability will make it easier to recover from a stall. However, maneuverability will be reduced. The opposite occurs for an Aft CG location. For the same aircraft, an aft CG location results in an increased flight range and maneuverability, and a decrease in drag. However, in this case, fuel will be isolated in the trim tank and the aircraft will be unable to use it. Therefore, flight range will be reduced. Note that Increasing stability about any axis decreases manoeuvrability and controllability, and increases stick (or pedal) forces.

The MAC (Mean Aerodynamic Chord) represents the chord of an imaginary airfoil that has the same aerodynamic characteristics as the actual wing. To be more specific, the CG is expressed as a percentage of its position along the MAC (%MAC) from the leading edge (Le), also called LEMAC. LEMAC: This is the Leading Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord. It represents 0% of the MAC. TEMAC: This is the rear edge of the MAC and is considered 100% of the MAC. If the CG is at a distance L from the datum, then the correct formula to calculate the CG position as a percentage of the MAC is: ((L - LEMAC)/MAC) x 100. The CG is at 25% MAC, which means it is 25% of the chord length back from the LEMAC. This means that the CG is located behind the Leading Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (LEMAC). Note: The option 'Forward of the Trailing Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (TEMAC)' is technically true, but it describes the position in relation to the TEMAC which is less commonly used as a reference point for CG.",

A flap extension creates an opposite effect. The CG reference datum is on the nose compartment of the MRJT1 aircraft. Any load/mass shifting further aft creates an additional positive moment. Conversely, any load/mass shifting further forward creates an additional negative moment. A flap extension moves a mass further aft causing an additional positive moment and, conversely, a flap retraction moves a mass further forward reducing the moment. According to the figure, with flap retraction from 40° to 0°, the moment changes by -16 000 kg.in and with flap retraction from 30° to 0° the moment changes by -15 000 kg.in. In other words, the greater the flap retraction, the greater the mass forward movement, the greater the moment reduction. Thus, a flap retraction from 40° to 30°, moves the mass forward reducing the moment by: -16 000 kg.in -(-15 000 kg.in) = -1 000 kg.in.",

The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on the distribution of weight in the aircraft. The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The CG of an aircraft can move but must remain within certain forward and aft limits, for reasons of both stability and control. CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall.",

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch, but the more downforce at the elevator is required to change the pitch attitude. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and horizontal stabiliser, called as \"trim tanks\", have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons: To provide extra fuel capacity. To maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum (aft) position for minimum drag, improved manoeuvrability and, as a consequence, for maximum fuel economy, as less downforce on the horizontal stabiliser is required. The fuel in these tanks may automatically drain as fuel is used from the centre and wing tanks or may be actively controlled by the crew through transfer systems.",

In order to counteract the resultant downward pitch of the aircraft's nose, the tailplane must generate a compensatory downward force, akin to the mechanism of a seesaw. This corrective force induces an upward movement of the elevators, which unfortunately amplifies drag, thereby intensifying fuel consumption and curtailing the aircraft's range and endurance. This elevation in downward force exerted by the tailplane can be likened to an increase in overall weight. Consequently, the stall speed of the aircraft also increases.

With the cg furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively controllable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward longitudinal control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight. If the CG is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the CP diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane beyond acceptable limits and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable.

When we do our take-off performance calculations for a specific runway in specific conditions, the main factor (and often the figure we are trying to find) is our maximum take-off mass (MTOM). In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. None of the structural or performance limitations are permitted to be exceeded. In order to ensure the aircraft remains within all of the limitations, a calculation is required to check which is the most restrictive on that particular flight. The single most restrictive limitation is called the allowed takeoff mass (ATOM) and is the lowest of performance limited takeoff mas (PLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). The most limiting (smallest value) of these will be the one where our aircraft will struggle most for performance.",

When you create more lift, you create more induced drag, and your performance goes down. The aircraft cruises slower with a forward CG location because of increased drag. The drag is increased because a higher AoA and much downward deflection of the stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. This pitch down moment has to be corrected by an up deflection of the elevator to keep straight and level flight. This increases the aircraft’s weight by adding a high downward force.

To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer (between the front and the rear CG limit). Proper CG location is crucial for maintaining the aircraft's stability and controllability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage: As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. When the CG is at the forward limit, the aircraft's nose may become too heavy making it difficult to raise the nose during landing, leading to a higher likelihood of landing on the nose wheel rather than the main wheels.",

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it.

In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

Increasing mass also affects the stall speed, VS, which is roughly proportional to the square root of weight. Many speeds used in performance calculations, such as the rotate speed, VR and the safety spped, V2, are extracted through graphs and tables and are based on the stalling speed from which they differ by a standard safety margin according to the rules and regulations. So, they also increase as the aircraft weight increases, so as to keep the safety margin constant. In case an additional baggage container is loaded into the aft cargo compartment without being entered into the load and trim sheet, then the VS will increase, but the take-off safety speeds will remain the same, thus reducing their difference from the VS and as a result the safety margin will also reduce.",

Most transport aircraft will usually have their aft CG limit just forward of the CP, because that provides to an aircraft pitch stability. If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively manoeuvrable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward pitch control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight.",

Traffic Load (TL) is the total mass of passengers, baggage, cargo (or freight), including any non-revenue load. Traffic Load plus Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is equal to the aircraft's Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM). Take-off Mass (TOM) is the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run. It is equal to the ZFM plus the take-off fuel. Take-off fuel is the remaining fuel at the brake release point after having consumed the taxi fuel. Landing fuel is the remaining fuel in the tanks on landing. For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Landing situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Max Allowed Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel (Block fuel - Taxi fuel) = 4 200 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 15 kg) = 1 120 kg. Landing situation: Performance Limited Landing Mass - DOM - Landing fuel (Block - Trip -Taxi fuel) = 3 610 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 440 kg - 15 kg) = 970 kg.

One IG of water weighs ten libres. To convert fuel volumes into fuel masses, we need to know that fuel is lighter than water. A volume of AVGAS weighs approximately 73% of the equivalent volume of water, which means that its Specific Gravity (SG) is approximately 0.73. This means that an IG of AVGAS weighs: 10 x 0.73 lb = 7.3 lb. Thus, 1 USG will weigh: 7.3 lb x 0.83 IG = 6 lb.",

            "explanation": "Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM) is the maximum permissible mass of an aeroplane with no usable fuel. The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. Due to the necessity of using the mass of fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks to balance the internal load, there is a restriction on the amount of weight that can be placed in the fuselage before fuel must be added to the wing tanks. Exceeding the MZFM limit can result in significant structural damage to the aircraft. The greatest stress on the wing roots happens when the wing fuel tanks are empty. To prevent the wings from permanently bending upward as fuel is used, manufacturers impose a maximum zero fuel mass on the structure. Since the stress during flight is at its greatest when the wing fuel tanks are empty, MZFM is determined during approach for landing. Fuel jettison is a procedure used to quickly reduce the weight of an aircraft by releasing fuel into the atmosphere. This procedure is typically performed in emergency situations when an aircraft needs to land but is too heavy to do so safely. Note: The option 'Immediately after fuel jettison (IFJ)' is not considered the correct option, because fuel jettison does not necessarily mean getting rid of all the fuel.",

Compute the maximum Traffic Load (TL) = TOM - OM = 64 730 - 47 460 = 17 270 kg. Find the existing load = (130 passengers × 84 kg) + (130 bags × 14 kg) = 10 920 + 1820 = 12 740 kg.

Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aeroplane less the usable fuel (DOM + Traffic Load or TOM - Fuel). For this question we will only consider the Zero-fuel and Take-off situations (ignoring the landing situation, since the given data do not permit so), subtracting from the Allowed Take-off Mass (ATOM) and the Maximum Zero-Fuel Mass (MZFM) structural limits the Actual ZFM and the fuel mass (where applicable), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: ATOM - Actual ZFM - TOF = 76720 kg - 55063 kg - 16299 kg = 5358 kg underloaded. MZFM - Actual ZFM = 62731 kg - 55063 kg = 7668 kg underload. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and then apply the additional cargo of 4500 kg we will check out if we are finally underloaded or overloaded and by how much: 5358 kg - 4500 kg = 858 kg underloaded. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Firstly, we need to establish the Lowest Allowed Mass for Take off: a: 51 300 kg + 10 800 kg = 62 100 kg b: 62 800 kg c: 54 900 kg + 7 700 kg = 62 600 kg Thus, the Lowest Allowed Mass for Take off is \"a\": 62 100 kg. The Operating Mass (OM) is: Dry Operating Mass + Take-off Fuel = 34 900kg + 10 800 kg = 45 700 kg. Therefore, the Allowed Traffic Load will be: \"a\" - OM = 62 100 kg - 45 700 kg = 16 400 kg.",

Traffic Load plus Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is equal to the aircraft's Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM). Take-off Mass (TOM) is the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run. It is equal to the ZFM plus the take-off fuel. Take-off fuel is the remaining fuel at the brake release point after having consumed the taxi fuel. For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Zero-fuel situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Maximum Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel = 71 204 kg - 40 195 kg - (13 800 kg - 215 kg) = 17 424 kg.

According to the question, we will need an extra amount of fuel, 8 300 kg, so as to ensure that this amount will be on board when landing in Paris. Additionally, taxi fuel, 180 kg, is required. So, adding the above fuel amounts, we get the Minimum Block Fuel: 7 054 kg + 8 300 kg + 180 kg = 15 534 kg, which is less than 22 000 kg, so we are within limits in terms of tank capacity. Also, check if with the above Minimum Block Fuel, 15534 kg, any maximum fuel load than can be loaded for both take-off and landing situations is exceeded, by subtracting the Dry Operating Mass and the Traffic Load from the two allowed structural limits given: Take-off: 69 002 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 16 390 kg (more than 15 534 kg, so we are within limits). Landing: 63 360 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 10 748 kg (more than 8 300 kg, so we are within limits). Note: No information has been given about the fuel cost of this extra fuel weight on the first flight. In real life we calculate for this using the flight plan adjustment figures or rules of thumb but the examiner obviously did not want to add the extra complexity of that to this question so has chosen to ignore it completely. This is good for us, of course, as it makes the question easier. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "This question, like many others, tests knowledge of both various mass definitions and also their relationship to each other. An ability to sketch and understand a diagram, is considered an essential skill in this subject. CAP 696 defines Operating Mass (OM) as the DOM plus fuel but without traffic load. Taking this definition further, the Basic Empty Mass (BEM) plus the Variable Load (VL) equal the Dry Operating Mass (DOM). To the DOM, if fuel is added then we arrive at the Operating Mass (OM). This fuel is normally take-off fuel prior to flight and usable fuel after take-off. More detailed definitions of both BEM and DOM from CAP 696 are found here: Basic Empty Mass (Basic Mass) is the mass of an aeroplane plus standard items such as: unusable fuel and other unusable fluids; lubricating oil in engine and auxiliary units; fire extinguishers; pyrotechnics; emergency oxygen equipment; supplementary electronic equipment. Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as: Crew and crew baggage. Catering and removable passenger service equipment. Potable water and lavatory chemicals. Food and beverages Note: The term 'variable load' is not directly defined in CAP 696 but the details are listed in the definition of DOM, as above.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. For this question, we will consider the take-off and landing situations, subtracting from the Maximum Permissible Take-off Mass and the Performance Limited Landing Mass limits the OM, the TL and the fuel masses (as required), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: Max TOM - OM - TL = 6400 - 4480 - 1870 = + 50 kg. Max LM - (OM- Trip fuel) - TL = 5430 - (4480-1090) - 1870 = + 170 kg. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and the \"+\" sign indicates that it is underloaded by 50 kg. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Regarding this question, it's worth noting that all the options are given in kilograms. Additionally, the question provides a fuel density of 0.8, which means we can't directly utilize the \"kg\" data from the provided figure. Instead, we need to calculate the total usable fuel in liters and then apply the fuel density (x 0.8). Assuming the pilot decides to refuel only the wing tanks, both inner and outer, for the aforementioned purposes, the total available fuel on-board will be: [(Outer tanks x 2) + (Inner tanks x 2)] x 0.8 = [(880 ltr x 2) + (6 924 ltr x 2)] x 0.8 = 12 486 kg",

            "explanation": "Although it is more common to consider the forces acting on an aircraft when in flight, as the total weight will act vertically through the centre of gravity on the ground too. CAP 696 defines the Centre of Gravity (CG) as: That point through which the force of gravity is said to act on a mass. Looking at the answers: 'through the main wheels of its undercarriage assembly.' --> INCORRECT. It is possible for the CG to act through the main wheels, but normally it is located between the nose wheel and main wheels. A CG behind the main wheels would cause the aircraft to tip over. 'through a point defined as the datum point.' --> INCORRECT. The datum point is the point on the longitudinal axis (or extension thereof) from which the centres of gravities of all masses are referenced, but not act through. 'through its centre of gravity.' --> CORRECT. See above from CAP 696 'through its centre of pressure.' --> INCORRECT. Lift acts through the centre of pressure.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: It appears that in the official exam, a table will be provided, indicating the necessary stabilizer trim settings for various configurations (flaps 5 and flaps 15) and different CG %MAC values. However, since we don't have access to the official annex, we have included the relevant information directly in the question text. The stabilizer trim is carefully adjusted to provide just the right level of assistance during rotation. When the center of gravity (CG) is situated forward, resulting in the aircraft being nose-heavy, it necessitates more assistance from the stabilizer trim. Conversely, if the CG is positioned toward the rear, there is already a natural tendency for the nose to pitch up (tail-heavy), resulting in a reduced requirement for assistance. In essence, the larger the CG number, the smaller the stabilizer trim setting number. Now, the question informs us that the CG position is at 7% of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC), which is very close to the forward limit of 6%. In such a situation, with a forward CG (nose-heavy), we would desire greater assistance from the stabilizer trim, thus indicating a high trim setting number. According to the given information, for a CG of 7% MAC, the appropriate stabilizer trim setting would be around 5 - 5.1. However, the pilots mistakenly set it to 4. This setting is more suitable for a rear CG, not the current nose-heavy condition of 7% MAC. Consequently, with this incorrect trim setting, there is insufficient assistance to handle the nose-heavy situation, leading to a longer take-off run.",

A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. As the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since less drag needs to be overcome, less thrust will be required and fuel consumption per nautical mile will reduce. As a result, the range will be increased for an aft CG movement. Note: An Aft CG movement (tail-heavy aircraft) results in a reduced longitudinal stability.",

Aircraft shall be reweighed if the effect of modifications on the mass and balance is not accurately known. (c) The weighing shall be accomplished by the manufacturer of the aircraft or by an approved maintenance organisation AMC1 CAT. POL. MAB.100(b) Mass and balance, loading WEIGHING OF AN AIRCRAFT (b) The mass and centre of gravity (CG) position of an aircraft should be revised whenever the cumulative changes to the dry operating mass exceed ±0.5 % of the maximum landing mass or, for aeroplanes, the cumulative change in CG position exceeds 0.5 % of the mean aerodynamic chord. This may be done by weighing the aircraft or by calculation. If the AFM requires to record changes to mass and CG position below these thresholds, or to record changes in any case, and make them known to the commander, mass and CG position should be revised accordingly and made known to the commander.",

Begin by drawing a vertical line from the OAT of +20ºC until it intersects with the pressure altitude of 8 000 ft reference line. From this intersection point, draw a horizontal line to the right until you reach the REF line. Then, follow the reference line until it intersects with the line corresponding to 3 600 lb. Now, continue horizontally to the right, crossing the next REF line. Draw a diagonal line until it intersects with the reference line representing a TAS of 120 kt. From this new intersection point, continue moving horizontally to the right, and there you can read a climb gradient of approximately 5.4%.",

A flap extension creates an opposite effect. The CG reference datum is on the nose compartment of the MRJT1 aircraft. Any load/mass shifting further aft creates an additional positive moment. Conversely, any load/mass shifting further forward creates an additional negative moment. A flap extension moves a mass further aft causing an additional positive moment and, conversely, a flap retraction moves a mass further forward reducing the moment. According to the figure, with flap retraction from 40° to 0°, the moment changes by -16000 kgin and with flap retraction from 15° to 0° the moment changes by -14000 kgin. In other words, the greater the flap retraction, the greater the mass forward movement, the greater the moment reduction. Thus, a flap retraction from 40° to 15°, moves the mass forward reducing the moment by: -16000 kgin -(-14000 kgin) = -2000 kgin.",

The question states that the distance between the nose and main wheels is 7 ft but it is normally easier to convert to inches (7 ft = 84 inches) as calculations in feet can prove difficult.

Moments and arms forward of the datum are considered to be negative and those aft of the datum are positive.

When determining the final CG position for flight, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in the loadsheet, in the actual mass of the item and its position on the aircraft. Fuel consumption, fuel transfer, passenger movement, crew movement and configuration changes in flight need to be accounted for. Also, both the CG position and the safe envelope evolve throughout the flight. Indeed, the weight of the aircraft evolves mainly as fuel is burned. As for the CG, its position is sensitive to various phenomena ranging from landing gear, flaps and slats position to passengers or cabin crew movements from one end of the cabin to the other. To allow a margin of safety for these variations, the Certified CG limits are reduced to the operational limits, i.e. the operational CG limits are more restrictive than the certified CG limits, because error margins have been taken into account. The Operational CG limits are determined by the Operator: one for Take-off and another one for Zero-fuel. Although there were attempts at developing systems to measure the aircraft weight and CG position, no robust solution has yet been found. The best way to make sure that the CG remains within a safe envelope throughout the flight, is to both define an operational envelope that includes safety margins and to perform a correct CG calculation.",

When determining the final CG position for flight, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in the loadsheet, in the actual mass of the item and its position on the aircraft. Fuel consumption, fuel transfer, passenger movement, crew movement and configuration changes in flight need to be accounted for. Also, both the CG position and the safe envelope evolve throughout the flight. Indeed, the weight of the aircraft evolves mainly as fuel is burned. As for the CG, its position is sensitive to various phenomena ranging from landing gear, flaps and slats position to passengers or cabin crew movements from one end of the cabin to the other. To allow a margin of safety for these variations, the Certified CG limits are reduced to the operational limits, i.e. the operational CG limits are more restrictive than the certified CG limits, because error margins have been taken into account. The Operational CG limits are determined by the Operator: one for Take-off and another one for Zero-fuel. Although there were attempts at developing systems to measure the aircraft weight and CG position, no robust solution has yet been found. The best way to make sure that the CG remains within a safe envelope throughout the flight, is to both define an operational envelope that includes safety margins and to perform a correct CG calculation.",

CG = total moment / total mass FOR DATUM AT NOSE: Total mass = 435 kg + 2385 kg + 2415 kg = 5235 kg Moment = mass x arm 435 kg x 0 cm = 0 kgcm (datum at nose, therefore, arm = 0 cm) 2385 kg x 583 cm = 1390455 kgcm 2415 kg x 583 cm = 1407945 kgcm Total moment = 0 + 1390455 + 1407945 = 2798400 kgcm CG = 2798400 kgcm / 5235 kg = 535 cm => The CG is located 535 cm aft of the datum (nose) – This option is not available. Therefore, we must relate it to the main gear. Main gear is 583 cm aft of the datum and the CG is 535 cm – 583 cm = -48 cm (forward) of the main gear. FOR DATUM AT MAIN GEAR: Total mass = 5235 kg Moment = mass x arm 435 kg x - 583 cm = -253605 kgcm * 2385 kg x 0 cm = 0 kgcm (datum at main gear, therefore, arm = 0 cm) 2415 kg x 0 cm = 0 kgcm (datum at main gear, therefore, arm = 0 cm) * “-“ because nose gear is located forward of the datum.

The operator must also account for and document the accumulated effects of modifications and repairs between weighings, by either weighing the equipment added or removed, or by using standard masses. It must re-weighed, only if the accumulated effects of these modifications lead to a change of the DOM by more than 0.5% of the MLM or the CG shifts by more than 0.5% of the MAC.

The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on the distribution of weight in the aircraft. The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The CG of an aircraft can move but must remain within certain forward and aft limits, for reasons of both stability and control. CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall.",

The fuel is fed from the tanks in the correct sequence to maintain wing bending relief and CG position. The CG position does change as fuel is burnt off, but within defined limits. If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Passenger and crew movements along the fuselage during flight are inevitable, but allowed for, resulting in CG changes. Small trim changes may be required to compensate for this movement. On most large aircraft, the main gear retracts sideways and creates no change to CG position. The nose gear can retract either forwards or backwards. As it does so, it will cause the CG to move a small amount in that direction, but is usually considered to be negligible. Any change of the tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) incidence angle does not have any effect to the CG position.",

            "explanation": "As the wing tanks fuel is consumed during flight, the CG moves aft towards the trim tank (since the fuel in the trim tank is isolated and not being burnt - resulting in a tail-heavy situation). An aircraft with forward CG is “heavier” and consequently, slower than the same aircraft with the CG further aft. For a forward CG location, a “nose-up” trim is required in most aircraft to maintain level cruising flight. Nose-up trim involves setting the tail surfaces to produce a greater down load on the aft portion of the fuselage, which adds to the wing loading and the total lift required from the wing if altitude is to be maintained. This requires a higher AOA (Angle of Attack) of the wing, which results in more drag and, in turn, increases fuel burn and reduces flight range. Furthermore, if the CG moves forward, the airplane becomes more stable. A forward CG with the increase in stability will make it easier to recover from a stall. However, maneuverability will be reduced. The opposite occurs for an Aft CG location. For the same aircraft, an aft CG location results in an increased flight range and maneuverability, and a decrease in drag. However, in this case, fuel will be isolated in the trim tank and the aircraft will be unable to use it. Therefore, flight range will be reduced. Note that Increasing stability about any axis decreases manoeuvrability and controllability, and increases stick (or pedal) forces.

Section 1 (top) is used to establish the Limiting Take-off Mass and the Maximum AllowableTraffic Load that can be carried, Section 2 (middle) shows the traffic load distribution and Section 3 (bottom) sums up the load and cross checks that any limit has not been exceeded. Section 1 must be completed first so as to find the three potential take-off masses (a,b and c values). The Allowable Take-Off Mass section of the load sheet is in Section 1 and it is equal to the lowest of the a, b, c values. The “a” value is the take-off mass you would achieve, if you loaded the aircraft to the MZFM and then added the intended fuel load and it is equal to MZFM plus Take-Off Fuel. The “b” value is the regulated take-off mass for the take-off airfield conditions as existing and among Performance-Limited TOM and Maximum Structural TOM “b” value is the lower one. The “c” value is the take-off mass you would achieve if you were to land at the regulated landing mass and then added back the trip fuel and is equal to the Max Landing Mass or Performance-Limited Landing Mass (whichever is lower) plus the Trip Fuel.

The CG is at 25% MAC, which means it is 25% of the chord length back from the LEMAC. This means that the CG is located behind the Leading Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (LEMAC). Note: The option 'Forward of the Trailing Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (TEMAC)' is technically true, but it describes the position in relation to the TEMAC which is less commonly used as a reference point for CG.",

A flap extension creates an opposite effect. The CG reference datum is on the nose compartment of the MRJT1 aircraft. Any load/mass shifting further aft creates an additional positive moment. Conversely, any load/mass shifting further forward creates an additional negative moment. A flap extension moves a mass further aft causing an additional positive moment and, conversely, a flap retraction moves a mass further forward reducing the moment. According to the figure, with flap retraction from 40° to 0°, the moment changes by -16 000 kg.in and with flap retraction from 30° to 0° the moment changes by -15 000 kg.in. In other words, the greater the flap retraction, the greater the mass forward movement, the greater the moment reduction. Thus, a flap retraction from 40° to 30°, moves the mass forward reducing the moment by: -16 000 kg.in -(-15 000 kg.in) = -1 000 kg.in.",

The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on the distribution of weight in the aircraft. The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The CG of an aircraft can move but must remain within certain forward and aft limits, for reasons of both stability and control. CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall.",

The Load/Trim sheet is in two parts: Part A (to the left) is a loading summary. Moreover, Part A is divided into three Sections. Section 1 (top) is used to establish the Limiting Take-off Mass and the Maximum AllowableTraffic Load that can be carried, Section 2 (middle) shows the traffic load distribution and Section 3 (bottom) sums up the load and cross checks that any limit has not been exceeded. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the certified envelope. It is where we plot graphically the positions of the CG of operational masses, such as Take off Mass, Zero Fuel Mass and Landing Mass. When completing load sheets, particularly for large aircraft, it is convenient to use an Index method to represent the large numbers involved and to simplify the calculations. Generally, Loading Index is a non-dimensional figure (i.e. a figure without unit of measurement) that is a scaled down value of a moment and the effect of reducing the magnitude of the moment to one that is much easier to use.",

Distance from mass to old CG: 15.5 m - 13.76 m = 1.74 m 4763 kg / 64 763 kg = Change of CG / 1.74 m Change of CG = 4763 / 64 763 x 1.74 = 0.13 m Since the initial CG position is aft of the datum and the LMC is added aft of the datum, the new position of CG will be shifted away from the datum and will be: New CG position = Old CG position + Change of CG = 13.76 m + 0.13 m = 13.89 m aft of datum 2nd METHOD CG = Total Moment / Total Mass Moment = Mass x Arm Total Moment = Old Moment + LMC Moment = 60 000 kg x 13.76 m + 4763 kg x 15.5 m = 825 600 + 73 827 = 899 427 kg m Total Mass = Old Mass + LMC Mass = 60 000 kg + 4763 kg = 64 763 kg CG = 899 427 kg m / 64 763 kg = 13.89 m Since the initial CG position is aft of the datum and the LMC is added aft of the datum, the new position of CG will be shifted away from the datum and will be 13.89 m aft of datum. (3) Check if the new CG is within limits CG limit: 16% - 46% New CG position: 13.89 m aft of datum. The new CG position needs to be converted into % MAC to check whether it is within the CG limitations. CG position % relative to MAC = CG distance from leading edge / MAC length New CG distance from leading edge = 13.89 m - 12 m = 1.89 m MAC Lenth = 4 m New CG position % relative to MAC = 1.89 m / 4 m = 47.25 % The CG limit is 16% - 46% and the new CG position is at 47.25% which means that the new CG is out of limits and the LMC cannot be loaded.",
