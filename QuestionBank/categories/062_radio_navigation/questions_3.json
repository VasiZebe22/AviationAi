NDBs are non-directional beacons that transmit a simple carrier wave with a modulation to overlay the morse code identifier. They are a ground station consisting of just one aerial for transmission. The ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) is the equipment in the cockpit which measures the direction from which the NDB carrier wave signal came, and points a needle directly towards the NDB in question on one of the pilot's instruments. NDBs are split into two use categories, en-route (for long range navigation) and locator beacons (for terminal procedures). As specified in the LO above, locator beacons are low powered NDBs, and have short ranges of 10 - 25 nm. They are often used as beacons denoting the approach holding pattern, or the final approach fix. They may be co-located with a marker beacon (the outer marker usually), but NDBs are different from marker beacons, which people do occasionally get mixed up.",

Furthermore, in general, the closer aircraft will receive the stronger signal. At position C, the aircraft would receive the signal unaffected by ground clutter and terrain, resulting in the strongest signal. Coastal Refraction Coastal refraction is caused by radio waves travelling faster over sea than over land. This results in a change in the propagation direction when a wave crosses a boundary between sea and land. The refraction at the boundary of land and water is a function of the propagation speeds over land and water plus the incidence angle relative to the boundary. Radio waves speed up over water, causing the wave front to bend away from its normal path and pull it towards the coast. This phenomenon is negligible when the aircraft is perpendicular (90°) to the coast as the wave continues to propagate straight through the boundary. The magnitude of the refraction increases as the incidence increases. The effect of coastal refraction can be minimized by flying higher.",

This leaves only one option for the solid line with crosses on it pointing at 272°, it must be the track indication. This makes sense as the wind arrow would cause a drift in this direction, and 8° left drift is therefore realistic in the scenario. Also, there is nothing else that this line could really be, after looking at the other possibilities. As drift is always from heading (where we point) to track (where we fly), then the drift here is classed as left drift, and we can see very easily that the difference is 8°.",

The distance information can be used to determine the aircraft position or flying a track that is a constant distance from the station (this is referred to as a DME arc). There are several way to plot a route on a chart: straight route plotted between radio beacons direct route plotted without reference to any paricular radio beacons and fixes are calculated along the track based on position lines plotted from radio beacons In general a position line is a circle with radius the ground distance between the point and the ground station and centre at the ground station. Pay attention: there are some quite similar questions regarding DME poistion lines with very different answer. The main problem is about the DME distance: should a pilot consider DME distace plotted on a chart like a Slant or a Ground Range distance ? In general we can affirm that there is a difference between Ground Range and Slant Range but that difference is negligible and not worth considering until you are VERY close to the beacon, at which point plotting becomes quite immaterial and difficult owing to the relatively rapid changes in distance, i.e. 3 NM change in range is not significant when 150 NM from the beacon but it is significant when you are only 5 NM from the beacon. As a rule of thumb, discrepancies only start to appear within 1 NM per 1,000' of height, e.g. when flying at 10,000' the discrepancies only start to appear within 10 NM, at 20,000 within 20 NM, etc. Even then, they are very small and hardly worth worrying about, e.g. at 35,000' 35 NM Ground Distance = 35.6 NM DME Distance, and 10 NM Gnd Dist = 12 NM DME Dist",

            "explanation": "A navigation Display (ND) provides a mode selectable flight progress display. The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a VOR/ILS mode, where the frequency of the VOR is indicated at the bottom. Figure 1 and 6 indicate is a full VOR and a full ILS mode respectively, on figure 2 you can see the plan mode with a large part of the route displayed and the True North indication at the bottom, figure 3 has no navaid tuned (no identifier displayed = MAP), and finally Figure 5 indicates ‘ILS’ at the bottom. Figure 4, however, has the VOR indication at the bottom left-hand corner and its frequency on the right. A course deviation scale is also displayed and further confirms that ND is a VOR mode display.",

In this question, our aircraft is crossing the 330 radial, and the slant distance is increasing a small amount, but by much less than our groundspeed, therefore, the groundspeed read-out on our DME will be lower than our actual groundspeed.",

The range of a VHF D/F signal is therefore the same as any line-of-sight signal, which can only travel as far as a straight line on a curved globe, plus a very small addition for curvature due to atmospheric refraction. Thus, the curvature of Earth causes much of the surface to be in shadow. Therefore, higher flying aircraft are more likely to be detected because they are above that shadow.

Using an omni-bearing indicator (OBI) display will always give a simple, fly left or fly right, localiser display no matter the chosen OBS course. A Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) has a simple Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) in the middle of the slaved gyro compass, which can be turned to face any direction, on the gyro compass, but when receiving ILS signals will only produce exactly the same display as the standard OBI, fly left or fly right. The direction of the CDI does not affect the CDI indications, just how we view them. When using a ILS back-course, the usual signal lobes are reversed, so an OBI display will be absolutely reverse sensing. This is the same for the CDI in the centre of the HSI, reverse sensing indications. However, the CDI in the middle of the HSI can be turned to face the front course of the standard ILS (needle pointing downwards when flying the back-course) which reverses our view of the indications again. This gives correctly sensing localiser indications for the HSI during a back-course approach, only if the CDI is set to the course of the standard inbound ILS.",

An easy way to remember this is that V is for Variation and V is for VOR. If using NDB/ADF directions, then the direction of the incoming radio wave is decided at the aircraft, so the variation at the aircraft would be used.",

Now we can interpret the HSI as saying that the selected course is 060º TO the VOR (as the \"TO\" indication is filled in), so therefore we are near the \"060º TO\" line (the 240º radial we drew earlier), and are pointing towards the VOR (forget the actual heading for now) As we have full scale \"fly right\" indication, which means at least 10º fly right to get onto the course, we can draw our aircraft as being 10º (or more) left of the selected inbound course, meaning that we are between radial 250 and 330 (which is the 90º point from the course). At this point, it is important to remember that the RMIs simply point their needle at the beacon, so the tail of the RMI needle is the radial we are on (the head of the needle is the QDM - the opposite direction to the radial). Therefore, we just need to pick the RMI with a heading of 010º (which they all have) and the tail of the needle between 250º and 330º, which is Figure B. Variation is not a factor as the HSI, RMI and VOR radials are all in magnetic. ALTERNATIVE METHOD When you're more comfortable with the differences between CDIs, RMIs and HSIs, you can begin to take shortcuts, which are very useful when flying using these instruments. The alternative method (for use on HSIs only), is that the deviation indication + the arrow always point towards the VOR. We can then work out which quadrant the VOR is in. For instance, in this example, the VOR must be somewhere between 060º (the \"TO\" arrow) and 150º (the direction of the deviation bar). The head of the needle (on the RMIs) points directly at the VOR, so we just need to choose the RMI whose needle points between 060º and 150º, which is figure B.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.02.05.04.08: Explain that multipath interference is caused by reflections from objects within the ILS coverage area. This question is not completely answerable from the question text alone, and the possible answers have to be considered to work out which one is correct. Therefore it is better to go through each and explain why it is correct/incorrect. A) \"The aircraft is heading in the opposite direction to the localiser thus the indications are reversed and change frequently.\" The fact that the aircraft is probably heading around the opposite direction to the localiser on downwind does not mean that it would show erratic readings and intermittent flags. If flying outbound along the localiser track, it would reverse sense, but this is the only truth to this statement. B) \"Lack of reception of the modulation signals due to a failure of the ground transmitters, so the aircraft receiver fails to lock onto the incoming signals.\" There is no known failure in the question, and this would remove the stable ident that is heard in the cockpit. C) \"Reflections from objects within the ILS coverage area leading to multipath signals outside the coverage area.\" Now this one is possible. The signals that are being transmitted by the ILS localiser and glide path are just radio waves like any other, therefore they bounce off obstacles and can cause rather wild, erratic readings outside the coverage area. They can even cause wobbly readings within the coverage area. Therefore, this answer is correct. D) \"The ILS shows incorrect indications unless the aircraft is established on inbound course and on the glideslope, so such indications are normal during radar vectoring.\" This option is far too specific. An ILS is still useful when more than half scale deflection left or right of the localiser, and when slightly above or below the glideslope, not only when fully established. In fact, there is a large and well published coverage area for LOC signals and for GP signals. It is correct that erratic indications are normal during radar vectoring, but not for this reason. Another potential cause that comes to mind is that the aircraft is flying through \"fake localiser\" side lobes, which are reverse sensing beams just outside of the coverage area, but these are usually a little more smooth than what is being asked in the question, and it is not one of the options in this question.",

These false glide slopes are actually side lobes. The presence of false glide slopes is attributed to various factors, including the presence of metallic structures near the transmitter and ground reflections, as well as the characteristics of the transmitting antenna. Pilots should remain mindful of their existence. The first false glide slope typically occurs at an altitude approximately double the glide path angle, which is around 6 degrees for a standard 3-degree glide path. In regular flight procedures, pilots typically align with the localizer and intercept the glide slope from below. This ensures avoidance of intercepting false glide slopes. An indication of a false glidepath could be seen in the rate of descent or when cross-checking the altitude. If the rate of descent required is higher than stated in the charts, for example 1500 fpm instead of 500 fpm, the aircraft will be on a false glidepath. If the altitude passing at the specific DME distance is not the altitude described in the charts, for example 3 000 ft at 4.5 DME instead of 1 500 ft, the aircraft will be on a false glidepath. There is no warning flag appearing on the CDI, and that is the reason why many incidents have happened when aircraft intercepted false glide paths and pilots did not realize. CDI WARNING FLAG Regarding the Warning Flag, it appears under the following circumstances: Equipment failure on the aircraft's receiver. Ground station failure. Indicator malfunction. Weak signals received or the aircraft is out of the beacon's range.",

It then shows the number of degrees deviation between the aircraft's current position and the \"radial\" line emanating from the signal source at the given bearing. This can be used to find and follow the desired radial. Deflection is 10° deviation at full scale (each side), with each dot on the CDI representing 2°. When used with a GPS, or other RNAV equipment, it shows actual distance left or right of the programmed courseline. Sensitivity is usually programmable or automatically switched, but 5 nautical miles (9.3 km) deviation at full scale is typical for en route operations. Approach and terminal operations have a higher sensitivity up to frequently 0.3 nautical miles (0.56 km) at full scale. In this mode, the OBS knob may or may not have an effect, depending on configuration. When used for instrument approaches using a LDA or ILS the OBS knob has no function because the courseline is usually the runway heading, and is determined by the ground transmitter. A CDI might incorporate a horizontal needle to provide vertical guidance when used with a precision ILS approach where the glideslope is broadcast by another transmitter located on the ground.

In some regions, where a steep angle glidepath is authorised, coverage is provided from the center of the localiser aerial to 18 NM ±10°, and 10 NM ±35°. Upper limit of the localizer signal vertical coverage is a minimum of 7° above the localizer horizontal plane. The protection range and height of ILS is 25 NM / 6 250 ft. Note 1: Any attempt to use the localiser outside the areas listed above may lead to false/reverse sense indications. Use outside designated coverage areas is therefore not permitted. Glidepath Coverage Vertical coverage from 0.45 θ to 1.75 θ above the horizontal through the ILS threshold (θ = glide path angle). This equates to 1.35° to 5.25° above the threshold horizontal for a nominal 3° glide path. Horizontal coverage extending in azimuth 8° either side of the extended centerline out to a range of 10 NM. The protection range and height of ILS is 25 NM / 6 250 ft. Note 2: Example of the glideslope vertical coverage calculation. For a glideslope of 3.3° the vertical coverage is as follows: 0.45 × 3.3° = approx. 1.49° (lower edge) 1.75 × 3.3° = approx. 5.77° (upper edge)",

            "explanation": "VORs transmit their signals via VHF (Very High Frequency) radio transmissions. These travel in straight lines, and will not go through solid objects such as buildings, mountains, the ocean, etc. This question mentions gaining the aerodrome weather from the VOR, which is possible as many airfield VORs have the ATIS readout on the VOR audio frequency. We call these signals \"line-of-sight\", as, if the antennas can \"see\" each other, they can transmit between each other. Of course, that depends on the power of the transmission, as higher power transmitters allow for a greater range. With the Earth being curved, this does pose a problem for long range transmissions between aircraft and ground stations, as the aircraft may not be within line of sight of the ground station. The ways to fix this are to get closer or go higher. The higher the aircraft gets, the further it can \"see\", so that means it can communicate with radio stations further away. The formula for the expected range of a transmission (Earth curvature limited) is: Distance (nm) = 1.23 x sqrt( height of transmitter (ft) ) + 1.23 x sqrt( height of receiver (ft) ) If either the transmitter or receiver is at sea level (0 ft), then you can cut out one term from the equation, making it: Distance (nm) = 1.23 x sqrt( height (ft) ) In this case, we are at FL 100 (10 000 ft), so our maximum range is; 1.23 x sqrt(10 000) = 1.23 x 100 = 123 nm (closest answer 125 nm)",

Effects of infringements of critical and sensitive areas It has been shown that critical and sensitive area violations have an effect on the aircraft systems. The magnitude and impact of these effects is dependent upon many factors including aircraft type, position, speed, geometry, equipment, size and speed of the violating object. Aircraft systems may absorb short time ILS signal fluctuations through the effects of filtering by on-board equipment and the dynamics of the airframe. Slow or bias type errors that are not detected by the anomaly detection algorithms result in indications to the pilot either through flags, aircraft control actions (from autopilot) or fluctuations of the cockpit display indicators. The length and magnitude of fluctuations are linked to the speed and time of the critical and / or sensitive area violation. FAA warns pilots of reports that ILS signal integrity is affected by equipment operating within the ILS critical area. \" In several cases, the aircraft autopilot followed ILS fluctuations causing the aircraft to pitch and roll excessively\" (FAA).

            "explanation": "For ADF their needle will always point towards the NDB. The head of the needle indicates the QDM, and the tail indicates QDR for the tuned NDB on a compass card/rose fed with magnetic heading. The nail shaped symbol on the compass rose represents the head or tail of the needle. We can see the blue nail between 230 and 235 degrees on the compass rose, with the sharp end pointing downward – which means it is the tail of the needle. The reading will be 232.5 degrees. (Midpoint between 230 and 235). Now if we look at the bottom left corner it was written “ADF 1 KUS” in blue, and that means the blue nail is associated with that NDB (1 means radio aid number 1). Combining all the information above we can deduce that the QDR for KUS NDB is 232.5 degrees. The nearest choice will be 232 degrees. Notes for further learning: The green nail at 170 degrees represent the second radio aid tuned for display. It has the sharp end pointing upward which means it is the head of the needle. Normally we should see some words on the bottom right corner like “ADF 2 NH” for example (in green colour). Somehow it was not shown in this annex. The aircraft is now tracking TO a VOR, as indicated by the solid white triangle (TO symbol pointing upward) ahead of the hollow white triangle (the symbol representing the aircraft). The identification of the VOR we are tracking to usually appears on the top right corner, but not in this case somehow. “NAV” on the top right corner most probably means we are in navigation mode, tracking on course 197 degrees (solid magenta line), on 017 radial of the VOR while almost centred and at 8.3NM from it. White solid line at 194 degrees is our current track with range markers on it.",

It aimed to address the limitations of ILS and offer enhanced flexibility to its users. Microwave Landing System (MLS) features: Worldwide availability with 200 channels. Azimuth coverage of at least ±40° of the runway's on-course line (QDM) and allows selection of glide slopes ranging from 0.9° to 20°. Usable range extends up to 20-30 NM from the MLS site. The MLS incorporates a built-in Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). Includes a secondary system for back course transmissions, offering guidance within ±20° of the runway direction up to 15° in elevation, within a range of 10 NM and up to a height of 10,000 ft. Operates in the SHF band (5031 - 5090.7 MHz), allowing installation in hilly areas without the need for site leveling. The MLS scanning beam can be interrupted to avoid reflections, eliminating course deviation errors caused by aircraft, vehicles, and buildings. Increased azimuth and elevation coverage enables aircraft to choose their own approaches, improving runway utilization and benefiting helicopters and STOL aircraft. MLS is designed to be compatible with various navigation instruments and systems, including conventional localizer and glide path instruments, EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System), auto-pilot systems, and area navigation equipment. MLS provides positive automatic landing indications and clear on/off flag indications for the localizer and glide slope needles. The identification prefix for MLS consists of an 'M' followed by two letters. The goal is for all aircraft equipped with MLS to operate according to CAT III criteria.",

Then draw the aircraft on radial 055°, probably it is easiest to draw it pointing in a similar direction of the HSI course as the heading is not given, as this is the most easily understood scenario. Now we can see that the aircraft is very close to the 060 radial, which we called the \"060° FROM\" course, and this is what our HSI will guide us to follow. As you can see in the annex above, or in your drawing, to follow the 060° course outbound from the VOR (the 060 radial), the aircraft is left of the course (as long as it is pointing in the correct direction). This will therefore provide a FROM arrow and a fly-right indication. We have set the heading as 020° in our depiction, but this makes no difference to the indication shown on the CDI in the middle of the HSI, which is what we must assume the examiner is asking about, it just makes things less cluttered. This particular depiction could perhaps occur if you were trying to intercept the 060 radial outbound (from original heading 020°) but overshot it.",

MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. MLS has the ability to interrupt the transmitted signal to avoid reflection by stationary objects (such as obstructions in the appropach path) which makes the system less sensitive to geographic location and obstacles. This and the relatively low cost of the system are its main advantages. Subsidiary advantages are the ability of MLS equipped aircraft to fly approach paths other than straight in and the single frequency used avoiding the requirement for frequency pairing.",

The critical area is protected because the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside its boundaries will cause unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal-in-space; b) the ILS sensitive area is an area where the parking and/or movement of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations.

False glideslopes will never be encountered when approaching the glidepath from below. An indication of a false glidepath could be seen in the rate of descent. If the rate of descent required is higher than stated in the charts, for example 1500 fpm instead of 500 fpm, the aircraft will be on a false glidepath.

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial (“signal bending by the aircraft metallic surafaces”) The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readings This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

When the pilot of a DME-equipped aircraft tunes the frequency of a VOR (or ILS) with DME, the frequency of the co-located DME is automatically tuned. The aircraft interrogates the DME ground station with a pulsed signal, and the station replies. Aircraft equipment measures the time between transmission and reception to determine the distance; from that, groundspeed and time to station can be derived. Associated beacons are beacons with the same ident transmitted at different tones. For VORs and DMEs to be associated they must be less than 100ft (30m) apart if used as a terminal aid. If used for any other purpose they must be less than 2000ft (600m) apart. Associated TACANs and VORs are called VORTACs. When beacons are associated the three letter Morse ident is sent every seven and a half seconds. One comes from the DME, the next three from the VOR. The pitch of the DME ident is often higher than the VOR ident. If beacons fail to meet these criteria they may be given similar idents. A DME within 6NM of an en-route VOR might have the last letter of its ident changed to Z. e.g. the VOR ident might be LIP and the DME LIZ.",

Remember that we are to the station. On the RMI, the indicators needle will always point directly to the tuned station. The tail of the needle indicates the current radial.

Therefore, a good way of remembering the frequency bands is having VHF as a starter band, and we can say that a well known VHF frequency of 121.5 MHz is between 30 and 300 MHz, so therefore we can create the bands above and below that, and so on.

            "explanation": "A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) is a ground-based, low frequency radio transmitter used as an instrument approach for airports and offshore platforms. The NDB transmits an omni-directional signal that is received by the ADF or Automatic Direction Finder, a standard instrument onboard aircraft. The pilot uses the ADF to determine the direction to the NDB relative to the aircraft. NDB's can be used to provide a non-precision approach to an airport. A pilot can make sure to be aligned with the correct approach path by maintaining the same QDM with the ADF, and can manage vertical guidance using their altimeter, with a minimum descent height/altitude. In terms of lateral errors permitted, flying an NDB approach, you must maintain a QDM/QDR that is ± 5° of the designated approach path. This is also the range in which an aircraft can be considered \"established\" on the approach. As the process of flying NDB approaches varies, depending on the cockpit hardware, this question could potentially cause some confusion, let's look at each option: \"The relative bearing must be less than 5º.\" This is incorrect, as the relative bearing (direction of the ADF pointer relative to the aircraft heading) will vary due to the wind correction angle. An aircraft could be perfectly flying an inbound course of 270º but with a 10º right wind correction, so heading 280º, the relative bearing would be 350º (10º left of the nose), but the aircraft would be established. \"The bearing pointer must be within 5º of the required course.\" This is true, as the bearing pointer indicates the QDM (when using an RMI or converting a fixed card ADF) and that must be within 5º of the correct inbound course for the approach. As long as that criteria is satisfied, the aircraft is considered established. The wording could be better to include all versions of aircraft hardware, but this is correct in essence, and far more correct than the other options. \"The wind correction angle must be less than 5º.\" The wind correction angle does not matter, as long as the aircraft is within 5º of the required QDM, it is established. \"variation due to reflections from terrain may NOT exceed 5º.\" Variations due to terrain reflections can affect NDB signals, but should not do so too much on NDB approaches, as this should be flight tested, etc. Nonetheless, NDB approaches have terrible accuracy and many errors, hence the high minimums. As we cannot determine the errors at any one time, we can only use the instrument readout that we have, so a high error does not mean that we are not established.",

            "explanation": "The modulation type of all ILS transmitters is the good old amplitude modulation (AM). The carrier oscillation in the localizer frequency range is 108.00 MHz to 111.975 MHz modulated with a 90Hz and a 150Hz tone signal. The ILS works by sending 2 beams up from the landing runway, one telling the pilots if they or high or low and the other telling them if they are left or right of the runway centreline. The ILS receiver on the aircraft measures the difference in depth of modulation (DDPM) between the signals For most ILS’s the pilots should be lined up with the runway centreline and on a 3 degree glide path, but on some ILS’s, like London City have a steeper approach of 5.5 degrees. The vertical beams of modulated signals are produced from a horizontally polarized antenna complex beyond the far end of the approach runway. They create an expanding field that is 21⁄2° wide (about 1,500 feet) 5 miles from the runway. The field tapers to runway width near the landing threshold. The left side of the approach area is filled with a VHF carrier wave modulated with a 90 Hz signal. The right side of the approach contains a 150 Hz modulated signal. The aircraft’s VOR receiver is tuned to the localizer VHF frequency ( is the same for both beams, only the modulation of te carrier wave changes !) that can be found on published approach plates and aeronautical charts. The circuitry specific to standard VOR reception is inactive while the receiver uses localizer circuitry and components common to both. The signals received are passed through filters and rectified into DC to drive the course deviation indicator. If the aircraft receives a 150 Hz signal, the CDI of the VOR/ILS display deflects to the left. This indicates that the runway is to the left. The pilot must correct course with a turn to the left. This centers course deviation indicator on the display and centers the aircraft with the centerline of the runway. If the 90 Hz signal is received by the VOR receiver, the CDI deflects to the right. The pilot must turn toward the right to center the CDI and the aircraft with the runway center line. (annex1)",

            "explanation": "All ILS Marker beacons operate on 75 MHz VHF (thus no frequency selections are necessary for the pilot) and radiate a fan shaped field pattern giving to the pilot an indication of range from the touchdown zone whilst on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations used to be equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead each marker. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker (OM) is located approximately 4-5 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach, and is used for identifying glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The light flashes blue. The Middle Marker (MM) is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1 NM away from the touchdown zone. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. It usually identifies decision height for standard CAT I ILS systems. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The light is amber. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker (IM) is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located on or just before the runway threshold, particularly useful for CAT II ILS, as it gives the decision height for that approach. The light is white. Tip: A good way to remember the colour of the flashing lights is with the acronym BAW - Blue Amber White - which is the airline code for British Airways. Given the diagram shown, we just need to be able to match the amber light to being the middle marker, and then read out the DME distance when at the middle marker, which is 1.0 nm (D1.0).",

Some of the available methods are the 45-180 procedure turn, the racetrack pattern, base turns, and the 80-260 procedure turn. The one in question has started with a 45º turn, so must be the 45-180 procedure turn. See the annexes above for the specific manoeuvre and the other main reversal procedures. ICAO Doc 8168 3.2.2 Reversal procedure 3.2.2.3 a) 45°/180° procedure turn ( starts at a facility or fix and consists of: 1) a straight leg with track guidance. This straight leg may be timed or may be limited by a radial or distance measuring equipment (DME) distance; 2) a 45° turn; 3) a straight leg without track guidance. This straight leg is timed. It is: i) 1 minute from the start of the turn for Category A and B aircraft; and ii) 1 minute 15 seconds from the start of the turn for Category C, D and E aircraft; and 4) a 180° turn in the opposite direction to intercept the inbound track.",

Annoyingly, there are currently no known MLS approaches in use around the world. Nonetheless, it can still be answered without too much difficulty. Microwave Landing Systems (MLS) are an improved method of guiding aircraft on approach to the runway, similar in accuracy to ILS, but with the capability for aircraft to fly segmented and curved approaches (if properly equipped), as well as reducing any multipath interference by blocking out signal areas. They were tested in the late 20th and early 21st century, but were far more expensive and only slightly more useful than the up-and-coming GNSS systems (now LPV approaches, GBAS, etc.), so never became widely used. To program them into the aircraft requires the channel number, angle of azimuth offset (relative to the extended centreline) and angle of glide path, as in the figure above. More complex systems can input the segmented and curved approaches. To address the other options, ATC do not give approach courses for instrument approaches, those are charted. The approach profile in the FMS could be a possible answer for the more complex approaches, but given that 3 is not correct, and 2 is correct, it must be 2 and 4. Note: the feedback on this question is not perfect, but has been followed as precisely as possible, so any further exam feedback would be appreciated. It can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.",

The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white )",

Because NDBs produce LF and MF radio waves, which travel primarily as surface (ground) waves for the purposes of directional navigation (as is required for NDBs), the ground that is being travelled over matters a lot. Water is flat, for instance, so surface waves travel over water faster and much further than a similar strength wave travelling over rolling hills, built up areas, and worst, mountainous terrain. Basically, the more obstacles and rougher the terrain, the worse the NDB signals travel. This is most prominent in mountainous terrain as the radio waves try and follow the contours of the ground, which means going over the peaks and into the valleys. The largest problem with this is a phenomenon known as diffraction, where the wave gets scattered slightly as it crests each mountain and tries to go down the other side. Reflection of the waves also could be an issue, but does not affect NDB directions received by aircraft as much as the relative diffraction of mountains.",

                "The lobe on the right- hand side has a 150 Hz tone"
            ],
            "explanation": "The localizer aerial transmits two lobes. The lobe on the left-hand side of the approach has a 90 Hz tone. The lobe on the right- hand side has a 150 Hz tone. An aircraft located to the left of the centerline receives more of the 90 Hz modulation and relatively less of the 150 Hz modulation. This difference between 90 Hz and 150 Hz received is called DDM (Difference in Depth of Modulation). When the aircraft receives more of the 90 Hz modulation (aircraft is located left of the centerline), CDI needle is deflected to the right. When the aircraft receives more of the 150 Hz modulation (aircraft is located right of the centerline), CDI needle is deflected to the left. When DDM is zero, the needle will be in the centre (aircraft on the centerline). The localiser of an ILS approach can produce a secondary \"back beam\", which goes exactly the opposite direction to the original localiser. This back-beam may be used during the missed approach guidance. Sometimes it is also used for non-precision approaches without vertical guidance on the opposite runway. Using the back-beam course will cause reverse sensing in localiser indications. An aircraft approaching from the opposite direction will have 90 Hz modulation on its right side and 150 Hz modulation on its left side, which is opposite than normal. This means that if the pilot selects the final course of the runway corresponding to the \"back beam\" approach, he will receive opposite CDI indications. The aircraft will receive more of 90 Hz modulation when it is on the right side, but needle will be deflected to the right ('fly-right' instead of 'fly-left'). The opposite will happen when the aircraft is to the left of the centerline (needle will be deflected to the left) In order to avoid reversed indications, the course of the \"front beam\" approach direction can be selected. For the specific example, the 'front beam' course is 136° and the 'back beam' course is 316°. While approaching runway 32, selecting CDI course 136° will provide normal deviations to the pilots, while selecting CDI course 316° will provide reversed indications. Left drift means that the aircraft is displaced left of the centerline. With the selected course of 316°, a full left deflection will be shown. Note: The option \"HSI showing a heading of 300°, with the selected course of 136° and a full right deflection.\" seems to be correct as well, but since we are flying towards the runway 32, selecting a course of 316° (approach runway course) is what the approach charts suggest (refer to the approach chart figure).",

We can be sure that the aircraft is within the coverage area in this question, as it is fully established on the ILS approach (at 4 NM it is most likely to be descending on the glide path as well as on the localiser). This leaves only one answer available, as none of the other options happens when within the correct coverage area of the ILS. Reflections of the ILS signals off objects can hit the aircraft at certain stages of the approach, altering the difference in depth of modulation between the 90 Hz and the 150 Hz lobes, and can cause a false movement of the ILS needles, which in turn can affect the autopilot if one is engaged.",

            "explanation": "Reference signal is a continuous wave, omni-directional signal that is frequency-modulated (FM). Regardless of aircraft position relative to the VOR, at a given range and any instant the phase of the reference signal is always the same. Variable signal is an uniformly-rotated signal at 30 revolutions per second that emits a directional signal. The relationship between the phase of two signals varies according to the position of the receiver around the VOR transmitter. This question can be solved using the following example: Imagine that you drop a stone into the water and concentric circular waves arise. This will be our Reference signal. Now, there are two ducks on the water at different places, but with the same distance from the centre. When the wave arrives, both ducks will move up and down at the same time. Consequently, if both aircraft are on the same DME distance around the VOR, they will have an equal Reference Signal, at the same time. On the other hand, if the ducks swim behind each other (on the same radial), they will move up and down at a different time. We can, therefore, conclude that for aircrafts on the same radial, the Reference Signal is unequal, at the same time. The Variable Signal works differently. Because of the moving antenna, the wave starts on every degree of rotation with another phase value. Therefore, if the aircraft are on the same distance, but on different radials, they will have unequal Variable Signal. If they are on the same radial (at different distances), we will witness the same phenomenon with the ducks behind each other - if the first duck gets the crest, the other will get the trough. Resulting in an unequal phase. Summary: For this type of question, the Varianle Signal is always unequal. Same Distance = Equal Reference Signal but unequal Variable Signal. Same Radial = Both signals are unequal.",

This unit radiates a field pattern, which develops a course down the centerline of the runway toward the middle markers (MMs) and outer markers (OMs), and a similar course along the runway centerline in the opposite direction. These are called the front and back courses, respectively. The localizer provides course guidance, transmitted at 108.1 to 111.95 MHz (odd tenths only), throughout the descent path to the runway threshold from a distance of 18 NM from the antenna to an altitude of 4,500 feet above the elevation of the antenna site. The localizer course is very narrow, normally 5°. This results in high needle sensitivity. With this course width, a full-scale deflection shows when the aircraft is 2.5° to either side of the centerline. This sensitivity permits accurate orientation to the landing runway. With no more than one-quarter scale deflection maintained, the aircraft will be aligned with the runway. Glide Slope Glide slope (GS) describes the systems that generate, receive, and indicate the ground facility radiation pattern. The glide path is the straight, sloped line the aircraft should fly in its descent from where the glide slope intersects the altitude used for approaching the FAF, to the runway touchdown zone. The glide-slope equipment is housed in a building approximately 750 to 1,250 feet down the runway from the approach end of the runway, and between 400 and 600 feet to one side of the centerline. The course projected by the glide-slope equipment is essentially the same as would be generated by a localizer operating on its side. The glide-slope projection angle is normally adjusted to 2.5° to 3.5° above horizontal, so it intersects the MM at about 200 feet and the OM at about 1,400 feet above the runway elevation. At locations where standard minimum obstruction clearance cannot be obtained with the normal maximum glide-slope angle, the glide-slope equipment is displaced farther from the approach end of the runway if the length of the runway permits; or, the glideslope angle may be increased up to 4°. Marker Beacons All Markers operate on 75 MHz VHF (thus no frequency selections are necessary for the pilot) and radiate a fan shaped field pattern giving to the pilot an indication of range from the threshold. The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS.",

Non-precision approaches which are pilot-interpreted make use of ground beacons and aircraft equipment such as VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR), Non-Directional Beacon and the LLZ element of an ILS system, often in combination with Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) for range. Lateral guidance is provided by a display of either bearing to/from a radio beacon on the approach track or at the airfield or, in the case of an LLZ only approach, by display of the relative position of the LLZ track on the aircraft ILS instruments and vertical guidance is based on the range from the airfield as indicated by a DME at the airfield or on track or by timing based upon passage overhead radio beacons on the track described by the designated procedure.

The first method is to imagine the ADF needle on top of the HI, and see where it points, the head of the needle would be the QDM, the tail of the needle would be the QDR. This method is better for coarse calculations whilst flying, and is effectively like imagining an RMI instrument. The second method is more mathematical, and is where we can add the relative bearing to the heading, to find the QDM. QDM = 300°(heading) + 215°(relative bearing) = 515° (-360°) = 155° QDR is the reciprocal of QDM. QDR 155° + 180° = 335°",

There are therefore facility performance category I, II and III instrument landing systems. The differences between the three facility performance categories are numerous, everything from the accuracy down to the monitoring is defined for all three facility performance categories, with many more variables in between. In the end, that means that they can provide increasingly good guidance to aircraft as the category goes up, and the associated minima get lower. As you can see in the annex above, taken directly from ICAO annex 10, facility performance category I can give accurate guidance down to a height of 100 ft or less, category II down to 50 ft or less and category III down to the runway (with the aid of ancillary equipment). It is important to note that the facility performance categories do not use the same altitudes at the ILS categories we use in normal operations. A facility performance category I ILS system is capable of providing information for a CAT I ILS as it gives useful information down to 100ft, which is lower than the lowest minimums of a CAT I ILS at 200ft.

            "explanation": "The Microwave Landing System (MLS) was designed to replace ILS with an advanced precision approach system that would overcome the disadvantages of ILS and also provide greater flexibility to its users. However, there are no MLS installations in use at present. MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) has the following features: There are 200 channels available worldwide. The azimuth coverage is at least ± 40° of the runway on-course line (QDM) and glideslopes from 9° to 20° can be selected. The usable range is 20-30 nm from the MLS site; 20nm in the UK. There is no problem with back-course transmissions; a secondary system is provided to give overshoot and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up to 15° in elevation to a range of 10 nm and a height of 10 000 ft. It operates in the SHF band, 5031 - 5090 MHZ. This enables it to be sited in hilly areas without having to level the site. Course deviation errors (bending) of the localiser and glidepath caused by aircraft, vehicles and buildings are no longer a problem because the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted and therefore avoids the reflections.",

The glideslope signal is in the UHF radio band and the Localiser is VHF, similar to VORs. The amount of each lobe received is then used to calculate your position in relation to the localiser and glideslope. Unfortunately, in creating these 'lobes', unwanted sidelobes are produced by both the localiser and the glideslope. for the localiser, they are just outside of the +/- 35⁰ ILS usable zone, and they are reverse sensing. Glideslopes have sidelobes also, which are seen as false glideslopes, reverse sensing and steeper than the true glideslope. The phenomenon in this question is occuring at about 45⁰ South of the inbound localiser course, and the aircraft receiver is showing that it is passing through the localiser, but in the reverse sense (a quick sketch is very useful to determine this). This is the perfect presentation of a localiser sidelobe, and should be disregarded by the pilots. Localiser sidelobes are required to be known in learning objective 062.02.05.01.09. Note: this could not be a 'siting error' as, even though they can occur for ILS localisers, they are erratic, very short-lived fluctuations of the ILS indicator due to beam reflections, not beam bending. They are also not a smooth, reverse-sensing error as a localiser sidelobe is.",

When European airways were first plotted out a lower accuracy of ± 7.5° was assumed. To keep an aircraft within the confines of an airway 10NM, maximum distance between the beacons was calculated to be 80NM. VOR can be classified as follow: A Terminal VOR (TVOR) is a low power beacon used as part of an airfield approach. TVORs share the lower frequencies with ILS. A Broadcast VOR is usually a terminal aid with a voice broadcast giving out the airfield weather (ATIS) superimposed on the carrier wave. A Test VOR (VOT) is a very low power beacon sited at airfields. It puts out a constant phase difference of zero in all directions. This allows aircraft to test the accuracy of their equipment on the ground. The VOR test function is selected with a course of 000° set. The Course Deviation Indicator should centre with FROM indicated, the RMI should indicate 180° QDM. The beacon ident for a test VOR is a series of dots. Pay Attention: do not confuse a TVOR with a Test VOR !!

It is more of an air law question, and even then it is on the edge of learning objective 010.06.05.01.10. The good thing is that it is a very distinctive question that will be easy to remember for the exam. Any further exam feedback on this can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. There are a few different places a holding pattern can be constructed, over NDBs, VORs, over a VOR/DME fix, or over an RNAV waypoint (not a conventional nav-aid). The most complex of those is certainly the VOR/DME fix. Technically a hold can be placed on 2 intersecting radials, but they are extremely rare. In the 1st annex above (Stockholm Arlanda - overview of all holding patterns), there are all the different types of holds shown. Starting from the top you can see HAMMAR (HMR) VOR, and there is a hold there with the inbound course of 191° and left turns and 1.5 minute legs (usually 1 min legs are used, but this is a higher altitude hold.) Below this is the ERKEN (ERK) NDB hold, based directly on the NDB. To the far left of the chart is the TINKA hold which is simply based on an RNAV/RNP waypoint. The furthest south holding pattern (NILUG) is a hybrid, it is an RNAV waypoint but with a VOR/DME fix given, so that it can be flown using conventional nav-aids. This is what the question is asking about. There are 3 more of these on the chart, ELTOK, BALVI and XILAN. Firstly, note that all these VOR/DME holds all have inbound courses directly towards the VOR, this is so the inbound course can always be tracked, which is a key requirement of any holding pattern (technically they can also track directly away from the VOR but I have never seen one published). In the case of the NILUG hold, the pilot will fly inbound on the 007° TO course (radial 187) towards TEBBY (TEB) VOR, until reaching a DME distance of 44.2 NM, then begin the right hand turn and do the rest of the procedure using timings (which is very normal), until established on the inbound course again, where tracking resumes until 44.2d, etc. They are easy enough to fly, if a little inaccurate due to being so far from the VOR; the difficulty arrives due to the fact that they can only be joined from particular directions. As can be seen in the annex above, they can only be joined (using conventional nav-aids) from: a) The VOR radial b) The DME arc (where specified); or c) The entry radial to a VOR/DME fix at the end of the outbound leg, as published. By far the most common way (and easiest) is by the VOR radial, but that is not one of the available options, so we have to say the DME arc defining the fix (in this case 44.2 NM). See the 2nd annex for a view of the DME arc for this example.",

Note 2: To double the range requires four times the power. NDBs are a medium range nav aid using frequencies from 190 KHz to 1750 KHz, in Europe usually 200 KHz to 455 KHz. These frequencies straddle the MF and LF bands but the system could also be described as using hectometric and kilometric wavelengths or it could be described loosely as an MF or hectometric aid because most of the frequencies are in one band. Surface waves are the primary method of signal propagation giving theoretical ranges of 300 NM over land and over 600 NM over the sea. But what appen to these waves when they pass from land to water or vice versa? These electrical differences in conductivity between land and sea affect radio waves. As low frequency waves cross the shoreline, they move abruptly from an area of low conductivity (land) to an area of high conductivity (water). That rapid change in conductivity changes the radio wave's \"phase velocity.\"As the phase velocity changes, the wave's frequency (what you dialed into the radio receiver) stays the same. The laws of conservation of energy and momentum come into play, and the wave bends. This is called refraction.",

That means that the course (of 090º) is going to take us closer TO the VOR if we fly it. Therefore, we are closer to the 270º radial than we are to the 090º radial and we can call this 270º radial the \"090 TO\" course, as flying that course with 090º track takes us TO the VOR. Now the VOR thinks that we want to fly that exact course inbound to the VOR, so it is going to give us fly right/fly left indications from our current position (remember, it does not know our heading, it assumes we are heading in the correct direction). Therefore, a fly right indication means that we are to the left of that inbound track, so we are North of the \"090 TO\" course, which is the 270º radial. Full scale deflection of a VOR CDI (course deviation indicator) is 10º, but we have half scale deflection, so we have a 5º deviation, therefore our radial is 275º",

After tuning the frequency of a DME (Distance Measuring Equipment), or any radio nav-aid for that matter, the signal must be identified, before it can be used for navigation. This can be done by correctly identifying the morse code signal produced by the nav-aid. A VOR for instance produces a morse code identifier at least every 20 seconds which has a pitch frequency of 1 020 Hz (as does an ILS localiser). A DME has a higher pitched tone of 1 350 Hz for its morse code identifier, and produces one at least every 40 seconds. Often you will see a co-located VOR/DME or ILS/DME, and they usually have 10 second intervals between identification codes, with the first 3 being the VOR/ILS and the 4th being the DME (at a higher pitch), then repeat. Hence, in that case, the DME identifiers are once every 40 seconds, and the VOR/ILSs are three times per 40 second cycle.",

MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) has the following features: There are 200 channels available worldwide. The azimuth coverage is at least ± 40° of the runway on-course line (QDM) and glideslopes from.9° to 20° can be selected. The usable range is 20-30 nm from the MLS site; 20nm in the UK. There is no problem with back-course transmissions; a secondary system is provided to give overshoot and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up to 15° in elevation to a range of 10 nm and a height of 10,000 ft. It operates in the SHF band, 5031 - 5090 MHZ. This enables it to be sited in hilly areas without having to level the site. Course deviation errors (bending) of the localiser and glidepath caused by aircraft, vehicles and buildings are no longer a problem because the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted and therefore avoids the reflections",

Thunderstorms and it’s lightning can affect radio communications at a much higher level, the ionosphere. The ionosphere can reflect radio signals transmitted from the earth. This enables the radio waves to travel long distances over the horizon and can distort signals traveling to satellites important to communications. In radio reception, radio noise is present. The noise is in the form of electrical signals always present in a radio receiver in addition to the desired radio signal. Radio noise is a combination of natural electromagnetic atmospheric noise (statics) created by electrical processes in the atmosphere like lightning. Lightning creates a radio signal (for example the crackle of static on AM-radio) that radiates outward in all directions.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. Wavelength and frequency are linked by the formula: c = f x λ Where; c = the speed of light (m/s) = 3x108 m/s f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) An Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) is the airborne receiver for NDB signals, and tells the pilot from which direction the NDB signal came, allowing for navigation. Receivers are made with a particular range of wavelengths in mind, to have the highest accuracy and efficiency. NDBs operate in the frequency range of 190 kHz to 1750 kHz. When inputted into the formula above, (rearranged to λ = c/f), this gives a wavelength range of 171 m to 1578 m. For this type of question, we need to use terms for how long that is (in orders of magnitude). So 1-10 m is metric (for metre), 10-100 m is decametric (deca meaning 10), 100-1000 is hectometric, 1000-10 000 is kilometric, etc. NDBs/ADFs operate in the hectometric and kilometric range. The terms go both higher and lower than metric, see the above figure.",

These discharges cause the most severe errors in ADF receivers. A static discharge in a Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) can be heard as a loud crackle on the audio and the needle will move rapidly to the source of the CB. If there are several active thunderstorms in the area the needle might point to them for a longer period. In this case, the needle would be pointing directly forwards towards the CB, which is between bearings 120º and 150º. As thunderstorms are incredibly powerful, the electromagnetic waves they give off can easily overpower that of a nearby NDB, especially if it is only a low-power locator beacon.",

            "explanation": "All ILS Marker beacons operate on 75 MHz VHF (thus no frequency selections are necessary for the pilot) and radiate a fan shaped field pattern giving to the pilot an indication of range from the threshold. The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white )",

It operates in the SHF band 5031 – 5090.7 MHz, vertically polarised. This allows it to be positioned in hilly terrain without requiring the site to be leveled. Issues such as course deviation errors (bending) of the localizer and glide path, caused by aircraft, vehicles, and structures, are mitigated as the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted, thereby avoiding reflections. The localiser operates in the VHF band between 108 and 111.975 MHz. This part of the frequency band is shared with VOR: the LOC frequencies are odd decimals (e.g., 108.1 108.15; 108.3 108.35; 108.5 108.55 -111.95 MHz). The glide path operates in the UHF band between 329.15 and 335 MHz. The glide path frequency is paired with the localiser and selection of the frequency is automatic.

Older systems interrupt the carrier wave (Keying) to send an unmodulated (but also inaudible) morse code ident (classified as A1A). User will have also erratic indications while the signal is interrupted in this type of beacon. To make the unmodulated parts of the A1A signal audible, ADF equipment incorporates a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BF0) that produces a signal slightly removed from the received frequency that is then mixed with it. The mixing of the two frequencies produces an audible beat frequency, tahat is the difference of the two. In aircraft with old ADF receivers the BFO mode is activated and annunciated when the “BFO” button is depressed, and permits the carrier wave and the associated Morse code identifier broadcast on the carrier wave to be heard. In modern FMS equipped aircraft whit modern ADF receiver, the BFO is automatically activated. Summary: selecting the BFO on makes the keying of the A1A carrier wave audible, allowing the A1A type of ident to be heard. Note: BFO is not needed for an A2A signal which is already modulated to an audible frequency.",

If you come across this question in your official exam, you should challenge it as it is an Instrumentation (022) question. The flight management system (FMS) aids the flight crew in managing automatic navigation, in–flight performance optimization, fuel monitoring, and flight deck displays. Automatic flight functions manage the airplane lateral flight path and vertical flight path. The displays include a map for airplane orientation and command markers (bugs) on the airspeed and N1 indicators to assist in flying efficient profiles. The flight crew enters the desired route and flight data into the CDUs. The FMS then uses its navigation database, airplane position and supporting system data to calculate commands for manual or automatic flight path control. The FMS can automatically tune the navigation radios and determine lateral flight path courses. The FMS navigation database provides the necessary data to fly routes, SIDs, STARs, holding patterns, and procedure turns. Lateral offsets from the programmed route can be calculated and commanded. In most modern transport aircraft, two DME frequencies in DME/DME mode for calculating the radio position of the aircraft. The FMGC automatically tunes these as a function of their best accuracy. The flight crew does not receive any indication that this process is happening.",

VDF (VHF Direction Finding) is a method of measuring the direction from which a VHF signal came. It has been used for many decades now, and is particularly useful as the transmitting aircraft only needs a standard VHF radio to ask for a VDF bearing from a suitably equipped ATSU. This can give them: QDM - Magnetic bearing from the aircraft to the station. QDR - Magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft. QUJ - True bearing from the aircraft to the station. QTE - True bearing from the station to the aircraft. With this information, the pilots can plot the location of their aircraft on a chart by drawing a true radial (QTE) outbound from each station that was used. 2 stations (and therefore 2 lines) can be enough to calculate the position of an aircraft, by finding the point at which they intercept. This is a process known as triangulation. It is important to get a large angle at the point of interception, as the larger the angle (optimum 90º), the better the precision of the fix. More than 2 VDF stations can also be used to get a more accurate fix. Distress and Diversion (121.5 MHz) have access to an auto-triangulation feature which gives them an immediate readout of the position of any calling aircraft, due to the reception of its transmission at multiple different locations with VDF capability. The computer allows the triangulation to be done immediately. Position is the only thing that can be gained from VHF direction finding though, so it is limited in that sense, but is very useful in the sense that only a VHF radio is required in the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "In the basic VDF system an arrangement of two pairs of dipole aerials (known as an Adcock Aerial) is used in conjunction with a single omni directional aerial. If the communications transmitter on an aircraft is tuned to the VDF frequency and the transmitter is activated, the aerials at the VDF unit will detect the incoming transmission and each aerial element will feed a signal to the VDF receiver. Since the aerial elements will all be at slightly different distances from the source of the signal, each will detect a slightly different phase of that signal at the same instant. The value of these detected phase differences will be directly related to the direction of the incoming signal. The phase differences are used to drive the bearing indicator. On some VDF units a simple digital read out gives the bearing. A ground DF station can give true or magnetic bearings. It is common to use the so-called «Q-codes» to represent bearings. These codes originate from the old days when telegraphy was used for communication, where it was convenient to transmit short codes instead of full text messages. Therefore, the Q codes are not abbreviations. A number of codes were used, but in aviation, only a few exist today. Listed below are the codes that are relevant to direction finding. QTE True bearing from the station (no wind) QDR Magnetic bearing from the station (no wind) QDM Magnetic bearing to the station (no wind) QTF Position of a station taken by bearings from D/F stations (no wind) QUJ True bearing to the station (no wind)",

Currently, we will have to assume that the green line with an arrow is the NDB indication, so the airport is to the left and behind us. The indication on the navigation display is weather radar, and a large return is directly ahead of us, at a range of 10 nm. As the return is so strong, it is very likely to be a cumulonimbus cloud, and is a storm. These clouds contain large amounts of static build-up and can form lightning from this. Both static build-up and lightning cause high power electromagnetic waves to be emitted on a range of frequencies, which can easily affect the indications of an aircraft's ADF. The onboard ADF will begin to point at the thunderstorm, instead of the NDB. The closer to the storm, the larger the effect.",

An Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) system uses a groundbased Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) that broadcasts an omnidirectional AM signal that can be picked up by the aircraft’s ADF system. This way the NDB system can be located on the ground. ADF is a short/medium range navigation system operating between 190 and 1750 kHz. A VHF Omnidrectional Range (VOR) system works on the principle of phase difference in the two radio signals transmitted from the VOR station. One signal is omnidirectional while the other signal is a 360degrees variable. (radials). VOR operates in the range of 108 and 117.95 MHz. The big difference between ADF and VOR systems is the magnetic variation. When NDB/ADF is in use, the magnetic variation will change at the aircraft instruments. While using VOR systems the magnetic variation will always happen at the station itself. When flying away from the station, the radial at which the aircraft is flying will always be the same indication since it’s not changing at the aircraft. The needle of the ADF will show a variation (magnetic variation) as the aircraft moves away from the station.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.02.01.02.03: Explain that by using more than one ground station, the position of an aircraft can be determined and transmitted to the pilot. VDF (VHF Direction Finding) is a method of measuring the direction from which a VHF signal came. It has been used for many decades now, and is particularly useful as the transmitting aircraft only needs a standard VHF radio to ask for a VDF bearing from a suitably equipped ATSU. This can give them: QDM - Magnetic bearing from the aircraft to the station. QDR - Magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft. QUJ - True bearing from the aircraft to the station. QTE - True bearing from the station to the aircraft. With this information, the pilots can plot the location of their aircraft on a chart by drawing a true radial (QTE) outbound from each station that was used. 2 stations (and therefore 2 lines) can be enough to calculate the position of an aircraft, by finding the point at which they intercept. This is a process known as triangulation. It is important to get a large angle at the point of interception, as the larger the angle (optimum 90º), the better the precision of the fix. More than 2 VDF stations can also be used to get a more accurate fix. Distress and Diversion (121.5 MHz) have access to an auto-triangulation feature which gives them an immediate readout of the position of any calling aircraft, due to the reception of its transmission at multiple different locations with VDF capability. Position is the only thing that can be gained from VHF direction finding though, so it is limited in that sense, but is very useful in the sense that only a VHF radio is required in the aircraft.",

Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, which can allow them to transmit further than \"line-of-sight\" space waves, but also makes their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The range of a NDB beacon is controlled primarily by its power and by the surface it is propagating over. Absorption by terrain is a very large factor in the reduction in range. The approximate formulas to determine range are: Max range = 3 x Square root of Power in Watts (water) Max range = 2 x Square root of Power in Watts (land) NOTES: The formula does not include the effect of ground conductivity or frequency.

The easiest known radials are often the OBS course and the reciprocal of that. That is important as in this case, the OBS course is 025º, but we have a \"TO\" indication showing when we set this, so we are closer to the reciprocal course, which is the 205º radial, or the \"025 TO\" course. As this is a quadrant question, we would also recommend adding in the two other dividing lines as Now we must work out what the CDI (Course Deviation Indicator) thinks is happening. It believes that we want to fly course 025º. It knowns our radial is not on the \"025\" side of the VOR, so it gives us a \"TO\" indication instead of a \"FROM\" indication. Now we can mark the Southernmost and Westernmost quadrants as \"TO\" quadrants, and that is the area our aircraft could be in. This also means that the CDI thinks we want to fly the 025 TO course towards the VOR, and the \"fly-right\" indication means we are left of track, which means we are to the West of the desired track. We are therefore in the quadrant between radials 205º and 295º from the VOR. Note: radials are magnetic bearings from the station (also called QDR), and the heading is not at all important to this question, as CDIs have no heading input, so therefore do not know it.",

As we have identified and followed the ILS down to short final by this point, we know that this sudden appearance of flags is a fault of some kind. When flags are shown, it is due to any of the items listed in the LO above, or possibly due to the received signal being below a certain strength. This narrows down the possible failures to a modulation problem. Also, the other possible answers are wrong as: The lack of LOC/GP ident signals would not be a reason for showing flags. Loss of both carrier frequencies would cause this to happen, but that is not one of the available answers. There is no cone of confusion for ILS transmitters, and definitely should be no similar error regions on short final. Signal strength that is too high would not cause distortion.",

The wind direction is therefore: 230º - 6º = 224º. Calculate the Wind Correction Angle using the Flight Computer: Set wind direction under \"true index\" (224º); Set the centre point over TAS (80 kt) and mark wind velocity up from centre point (over 100 kt); Set the Course under \"true index\" (257º); Wind Correction Angle reads between centre line and Wind Velocity Mark => WCA of approx. 8º We can now calculate the Magnetic Heading = 257º - 8º = 249º Magnetic Bearing = Relative Bearing + Magnetic Heading The Magnetic Bearing to the station is the reciprocal of the Magnetic Bearing from the station: 257º - 180º = 077º Magnetic Bearing = Relative Bearing + Magnetic Heading 077º = RB + 249º RB = 077º - 249º RB = -172º + 360º = 188º",

            "explanation": "NOTE: This question has 2 main problems. The first is that the answers are very close together and we cannot perfectly recreate the original exam annex, so therefore there is some potential for differences to occur, which make the answers very close to each other, and difficult to decide. The second problem is that the question mentions a deviation, which should not be the case, as a gyromagnetic compass (which is inside an RMI) is required to be less than 1º, so no deviation has to be applied. We previously assumed that deviation should not be applied, but it appears that some authorities are assuming it to be applied, so now we are applying it. We think that this is an error which could be appealed, but we have not heard of a successful appeal of this question yet. We have feedback from Poland and Austro Control that the answer \"272º\" is INCORRECT. We have therefore changed our correct answer to 270º, assuming that deviation is to be applied. This answer is completely unconfirmed though, so please send any further exam feedback you might have, thank you! To work out the answer, we need to identify which of the needles is pointing at the NDB in question. In the bottom left of the instrument, the yellow needle is pointing at \"NAV\", and the green needle at \"ADF\", so the green needle is the one we wish to use. The head of the green ADF needle is pointing directly at the NDB, so that is our QDM, the magnetic bearing towards the beacon. We find the reciprocal of that number (or look at the tail of the needle) to find the QDR, the magnetic bearing (well technically the compass bearing if we are applying deviation - see the note above) from the beacon to our aircraft. We now need to adjust that for the deviation and variation using the following phrases: Deviation West, Compass Best Variation East, Magnetic Least Or using the following table. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 266º 2ºW (-2º) 264º 6ºE (+6º) 270º",

However, the back-beam approach is shown in an inverted sense. The localiser is a set course in the direction of the front-beam approach along the centreline. In the case of a back-beam, the deviation bar shows the offset in the front sense, so an inverted interpretation is necessary.

The airborne system identifies its own unique stream of pulse pairs and measures the time of arrival electronically, between the start of the interrogation and the reception of the ground transponder's replies. Given the time delay (minus known times such as the 50 microseconds), the distance between the aircraft and the DME ground station can be quite precisely calculated. As there is only one interrogation frequency and one reply frequency for each DME ground station, they can only service a certain number of pulses per second, and it ends up meaning that the DME becomes saturated with around 100 aircraft using it, and it will then prioritise the pulses with the strongest signal.

This forms the familiar racetrack pattern. An NDB simply produces a signal of particular frequency, and the ADF receiver in our aircraft picks this up, and tells us from where it came. This is very simple, and means we can follow an ADF needle all the way to the beacon, when it will then become very sensitive, and go from pointing ahead of the aircraft to pointing behind it, as per the location of the NDB. This is different from a VOR, which we would track inbound via a CDI (course deviation indicator) which flicks from TO to FROM upon passing the beacon, and also has a cone of confusion.",

The VOR will give a TO indication if you are on the opposite side from the selected radial. In this case, we have previously established that we are on radial 266º, therefore we will get a TO indication. In order to intercept the selected course, we must turn right (towards radial 236º => reciprocal of selected course 056º). When on radial 236º, the needle will be centred and the indication will be \"TO\". In this case the course of 056° is selected = a 30° displacement from the current radial 266° (current radial - reciprocal of selected course). On a standard CDI, each dot represents a 2º deviation from the selected radial, with a maximum deviation indication of 5 dots either side = a total of 10º. In this case, the radial deviation is 30º, therefore the CDI will indicate a full-scale deviation, with the needle being displaced to the right. Note: It is always important to remember that your aircraft's heading does not affect the To/From flag and Left, Right, and Centered CDI indications on your VOR instrument. Your aircraft's position relative to the VOR beacon and the radial you have selected does.",

This method is better for coarse calculations whilst flying, and is effectively like imagining an RMI instrument. The second method is more mathematical, and is where we can add the relative bearing to the heading, to find the QDM/QDR. In this case for the QDR we use the tail of the needle.

This indication is shown directly on the display. The OBS (Omni Bearing Selector) which is used for VOR radial tracking does not have an impact on the displayed ILS readings, the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) will just show \"fly left\" or \"fly right\" according to the signals it receives. A Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) has a simple CDI in the middle of the slaved gyro compass, which can be turned to face any direction on the gyro compass, but when receiving ILS signals will only show exactly what it receives, fly left or fly right. The direction of the CDI does not affect the CDI localiser indications, just how we view them. The localiser of an ILS approach can produce a secondary \"back beam\", which goes exactly the opposite direction to the original localiser. This will allow for an approach to be performed using this \"back beam\", but it is limited by the fact that it will be reverse sensing in localiser indications, and has no glide path signal, so is a non-precision approach only. If the back beam is not required, it is often suppressed to avoid any confusion. See the second annex above, an approach chart for a back course approach. The charted approach course is 016º, but the standard ILS front course approach is to the opposite runway, and is 196º inbound. If we related this chart to our question, we are going to fly 016º inbound course using the LOC back beam, and have our HSI course set to 016º (As we are about to discuss, this is actually not the best course to set). When using a ILS back-course, the usual signal lobes are reversed, so the CDI in the centre of the HSI will be reverse sensing. This is the scenario of this question, and what we see on the left hand side of the first annex above, the HSI is reverse sensing with the \"back course\" direction set. Usually, however, we actually set the direction of the ILS front course (right hand side of the annex), which reverses the direction again, and gives us correctly sensing indications. This has NOT been done in this question.",

To start with, draw the VOR (Magnetic North up) and lines coming out of it representing the course selected on the HSI (in this case radials 200º and 020º - label them). Now we can interpret the HSI as saying that the selected course is 200º TO the VOR (as the \"TO\" indication is filled in), so therefore we are near the \"020º FROM\" line (the 020º radial we drew earlier), but are pointing towards the VOR. You can twist your paper to look in this direction for the easiest understanding, you will want to be looking backwards down the 020 radial you drew earlier. As we have half scale \"fly right\" indication, which means 5º fly right to get onto the course, we can draw our aircraft as being 5º left of the selected inbound course, meaning that we are on radial 025. At this point, it is important to remember that the RMIs simply point their needle at the beacon, so the tail of the RMI needle is the radial we are on (the head of the needle is the QDM - the opposite direction to the radial). Therefore, we just need to pick the RMI with a heading of 210º (which they all have) and the tail of the needle on 025º, which is Figure B. Variation is not a factor as the HSI, RMI and VOR radials are all in magnetic.",

The problem is that the wind will push them off track (if there is any crosswind), but the aircraft will just change its heading to point at the NDB again, meaning that they end up flying a curved path towards the beacon, ending almost completely into wind. This is not efficient, and can cause dangers with terrain clearance and other traffic. A visual representation can be seen in the annex above. Tracking, on the other hand, is a more correct way to fly using an NDB, and this requires the pilot to choose an inbound or outbound course from the beacon, and maintain it by applying a wind correction angle to their heading, so that their track is always directly towards or away from the NDB, on the chosen radial. It is a little more complex to fly, but far more useful. Not that homing can only take you TO an NDB, whereas the tracking technique can guide aircraft TO and FROM NDBs.",

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial (is caused by the refraction from the aircraft’s fuselage). The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readings This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

Taking into account the main delay of the station it then uses this time to calculate the slant range to the ground station. The distance is usually indicated in nautical miles. The interrogator can be in three different modes (states): SEARCH mode TRACK mode MEMORY mode In SEARCH mode, the interrogator attempts to set up a connection to a ground station and to synchronize to this ground station. In this mode, the pulse repetition rate can be increased up to 150 ppps (ppps = pulse pairs per second) to speed up the search process, much more than in track mode. DME and TACAN ground stations always send out a certain number of pulses per second (squitter pulses and replies to requests of planes). Since all these pulses are randomized, the interrogator uses correlation methods to find the replies to its own interrogations.",

Each has its own frequency; localisers use the frequency that tunes the ILS, (somewhere in the lower half of the VHF NAV band) such as 109.5 MHz, whereas glidepaths use a linked frequency in the UHF band that we do not have to input in the cockpit. The localiser (LOC) and glidepath (GP) also act in the same way, they produce two individual signals on their frequency, one signal (amplitude) modulated at 150 Hz and the other modulated at 90 Hz. These are produced in lobes with slightly different directions, as can be seen in the annex above. The LOC receiver then measures the difference in depth of modulation between the 150 Hz modulated signal and the 90 Hz modulated one, and if the difference is zero, then the modulation is equal and the aircraft is on the centreline. If the 150 Hz has deeper modulation, the the aircraft is to the right of course (and it also knows by how much), and vice versa for 90 Hz. The GP receiver also measures DDM and does the same thing, but with 150 Hz meaning \"too low\" and 90 Hz meaning \"too high\". Therefore, when on the centreline and correct glidepath, the difference in depth of modulation for both receivers will be zero.",

There are 2 different nav-aids which operate in the VHF-NAV band, which spans from 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz: VORs ILSs (specifically the ILS localisers) The VHF-NAV frequency band is split into frequencies with 50 kHz spacing (108.000 MHz, 108.050 MHz, 108.100 MHz, etc.). ILS localiser frequencies are less common, and have smaller range, so less chance of 2 nearby frequencies interfering. They therefore require less available frequencies, and only use the band from 108 - 112 MHz. Within this range, they only use the odd numbered decimals (and odd + 50 kHz), so ILSs would be allocated onto frequencies (such as 108.500 MHz, 108.550 MHz, 111.900 MHz, 111.950 MHz, etc.).

DME-P is a precision form of the usual Distance Measuring Equipment, which allows an aircraft to know where it is in 3-dimensional space, allowing for curved and segmented approaches using the MLS system. An MLS without a serviceable DME-P (Precision DME) may provide approach guidance, however the curved and segmented approach capabilities are lost, as the segments can no longer be defined in the 3D space. Nevertheless, if the aircraft is to be flown along the magnetic track of the runway centreline, the AZ and EL functions can provide approach guidance in the form of a straight-on approach, which provides an ILS-type of approach in terms of flight path.",

As seen in the figure, there are 2 lobes on the glidepath. One lobe at 90 Hz which indicates that the aircraft is above the glidepath. And one lobe at 150 Hz which indicates that the aircraft is below the glidepath. The centre is typically set to a 3° glidepath. This is not a perfect system, and the glidepath can suffer from the presence of \"false glidepaths\" above the correct one. These are due to both the weak sidelobes of the original 150 Hz and 90 Hz lobes, which are created and intensified by the reflection of the lower signals off the ground, or nearby obstacles. This is the similar to multipath interference of the localiser, but is more easy to predict. These false glidepaths are reverse sensing (see 2nd annex above) and usually exist at odd multiples of the original glidepath, and are the reason why we procedurally will intercept the glidepath from below, to avoid encountering a false glidepath.

NDB bearing: apply the variation at the aircraft’s position. Because this is where the bearing is obtained from, the NDB equipment calculates the bearing information at the equipment onboard so you need to apply the variation at the same location. VOR radial: apply the variation at the VOR’s position. Because this is where the radial is obtained from, the VOR station, whatever the VOR is conventional or Doppler it identifies the radial where you are on, and then send it to you, so you have to apply the variation where the station is located at. As far as the variation at the VOR station is 2W and following the rule of Variation west magnetic is best so we have to subtract the variation from the readout radial to get the true bearing in order to plot it on the chart or for any other usage (190° - 2° = 188°).

However, there are few MLS installations in use at present and they are likely to co-exist with ILS for a long time. MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. A component of a Microwave Landing System (MLS) consisting of an Super High Frequency (SHF) transmitter radiating signals to provide vertical indications as an angular value to aircraft approaching the runway. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) has the following features: There are 200 channels available worldwide. The azimuth coverage is at least ± 40° of the runway on-course line (QDM) and glideslopes from.9° to 20° can be selected. The usable range is 20-30 nm from the MLS site; 20nm in the UK. There is no problem with back-course transmissions; a secondary system is provided to give overshoot and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up to 15° in elevation to a range of 10 nm and a height of 10,000 ft. It operates in the SHF band, 5031 - 5090 MHZ. This enables it to be sited in hilly areas without having to level the site. Course deviation errors (bending) of the localiser and glidepath caused by aircraft, vehicles and buildings are no longer a problem because the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted and therefore avoids the reflections",

The middle marker on the approach plate says that the middle marker is located at D0.5, which means it is 0.5 nm from the DME. This usually means that the aircraft is 0.5 nm from the threshold, or from touchdown, depending on the approach, but either gives us the correct answer, and lines up with the usual positioning of the middle marker. There is also a distance indicator from the runway at the bottom of the diagram, saying 0.5 nm.",

The localizer (LOC) ground antenna array is located on the extended centerline of the instrument runway of an airport, remote enough from the opposite (approach) end of the runway to prevent it from being a collision hazard. This unit radiates a field pattern, which develops a course down the centerline of the runway toward the middle markers (MMs) and outer markers (OMs), and a similar course along the runway centerline in the opposite direction. These are called the front and back courses, respectively. The localizer provides course guidance, transmitted at 108.1 to 111.95 MHz (odd tenths only), throughout the descent path to the runway threshold from a distance of 18 NM from the antenna to an altitude of 4,500 feet above the elevation of the antenna site. The localizer course is very narrow, normally 5°. This results in high needle sensitivity. With this course width, a full-scale deflection shows when the aircraft is 2.5° to either side of the centerline. This sensitivity permits accurate orientation to the landing runway. With no more than one-quarter scale deflection maintained, the aircraft will be aligned with the runway. Glide Slope. Glide slope (GS) describes the systems that generate, receive, and indicate the ground facility radiation pattern. The glide path is the straight, sloped line the aircraft should fly in its descent from where the glide slope intersects the altitude used for approaching the FAF, to the runway touchdown zone. The glide-slope equipment is housed in a building approximately 750 to 1,250 feet down the runway from the approach end of the runway, and between 400 and 600 feet to one side of the centerline. The course projected by the glide-slope equipment is essentially the same as would be generated by a localizer operating on its side. The glide-slope projection angle is normally adjusted to 2.5° to 3.5° above horizontal, so it intersects the MM at about 200 feet and the OM at about 1,400 feet above the runway elevation. At locations where standard minimum obstruction clearance cannot be obtained with the normal maximum glide-slope angle, the glide-slope equipment is displaced farther from the approach end of the runway if the length of the runway permits; or, the glideslope angle may be increased up to 4°. Marker Beacons All Markers operate on 75 MHz VHF (thus no frequency selections are necessary for the pilot) and radiate a fan shaped field pattern giving to the pilot an indication of range from the threshold. The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS.",

As long as you tune the front course for the localizer, you won't get reverse sensing. When configured properly, you can fly the LOC BC approach with normal sensing, and fly \"to the needle\" like you do in all other navigation. However, in this case, it seems that the pilot has set the current inbound course (back course), therefore s/he will get reverse sensing. The half-scale deflection to the right of the needle indicates that the aircraft is deviating to the right of the localizer course. The pilot needs to make corrections to the left to bring the aircraft back onto the localizer course to ensure that the aircraft is aligned with the runway centerline during the final approach and landing.",

After a short delay of 50 microseconds the ground station then retransmits them. The time delay between sending and receiving the pulses is converted to a range readout. The aircraft equipment is known as the interrogator, as it initiates the exchange. The ground equipment is called a transponder as it replies. The aeroplane must distinguish between its own pulses returning and those of other aircraft. So the pulse trains are made unique to each aeroplane by using a random or “jittered\" PRF. Therefore the time interval between the paired pulses is random and the chance of two pulse trains being identical is effectively nil. The aeroplane must distinguish between retransmitted pulses from the transponder and reflected pulses from the ground. To overcome this the transponder on the ground retransmits at a different frequency, 63 MHz apart from the interrogator. To make sure that the ground equipment is not triggered by other UHF transmissions it will only reply to pairs of pulses separated by 12 micro seconds.",

The NDB transmits an omni-directional signal that is received by the ADF or Automatic Direction Finder, a standard instrument onboard aircraft. The pilot uses the ADF to determine the direction to the NDB relative to the aircraft. To navigate using the ADF, the pilot enters the frequency of the NDB and the compass card (or arrow) on the ADF will indicate the heading to the station. The signal is transmitted on an uninterrupted 24/7 basis. An audible Morse Code call sign of one or more letters or numbers is used to identify the NDB being received. NDB’s used for aviation are standardized by ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organization, Annex 10 which specifies that NDB be operated on a frequency between 190 to 1800 kHz. The main components of an NDB ground station are the Beacon transmitter, Antenna Tuning Unit and Antenna. Typically NDBs have output power from 25 to 125 watts for reception up to approx. 100 NM. Higher power systems from 500 to 1000 Watts are used for longer range applications. Range depends on a number of factors such as output power, antenna, ground conductivity, frequency, site conditions, latitude, and the condition of the ADF receiver.",

When a VOR frequency is combined with a co-located Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), it allows for an immediate determination of both range and bearing, referred to as a Rho-Theta fix. VOR operates within the frequency range of 108 to 117.95 MHz. For the band 108-112 MHz (band shared with ILS) available frequencies are 108.0, 108.05, 108.20, 108.25, 108.40, 108.45 …. 111.85 MHz (even decimals and even decimals plus 0.05 MHz). Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) is a secondary radar system that allows an aircraft to determine its distance from a ground station. A pilot can obtain precise magnetic bearings from a VHF Omni-range (VOR) beacon and precise slant ranges from a DME. DME, with emission code P0N, operates within the UHF band, spanning from 960 to 1215 MHz with 1 MHz intervals, resulting in 252 available spot frequencies or channels. There is consistently a +/- 63 MHz frequency difference between the interrogation and transponding frequencies. Civil aircraft typically utilize cost-effective VOR/DME equipment and choose the appropriate paired VHF frequency to obtain range information from either a DME or military TACAN facility. In summary, in order to receive distance and bearing information from a VOR/DME station, the VHF frequency of the VOR should be used. This frequency will be between 108 to 117.95 MHz and for the frequencies between 108-112 MHz the digit after the decimal should be even or even plus 0.05.",

NDBs are non-directional beacons that transmit a simple carrier wave with a modulation to overlay the morse code identifier. They are a ground station consisting of just one aerial for transmission. The ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) is the equipment in the cockpit which measures the direction from which the NDB carrier wave signal came, and points a needle directly towards the NDB in question on one of the pilot's instruments. NDBs operate between 190 and 1750 kHz, which spans both the LF (Low Frequency, 30 - 300 kHz) and MF (Medium Frequency, 300 - 3000 kHz) frequency bands. These bands of electromagnetic radiation usually travel best as ground waves (surface waves), meaning that they travel long distances by \"clinging\" to the Earth's surface. This makes NDBs very long range, and moreover smooth surfaces such as the sea. The night effect is one of the many effects which reduce the accuracy and reliability of NDBs. At night, the Earth's lower ionosphere becomes weaker due to the lack of activity caused by sunlight. The bottom layer (D-layer) of the ionosphere had previously been blocking the NDB waves from getting up any higher than this, but is now much weaker, so the NDB radio waves can reach the E and F layers of the ionosphere, where the refraction of the ionised particles causes the waves to bend and return back towards the surface. Note: This effect is due to refraction, but EASA often refer to it as reflection, as that is what it looks like from a distance. As long as you understand this, there should be no issue in the exams. The big problem with this is that now, the NDB signal is travelling as a ground wave and as a sky wave (bouncing off the ionosphere), and we can begin to witness fading, as the two signals interfere with each other. Another massive problem is that the reflection (refraction) off the ionosphere can easily change the direction and polarization of the radio waves, and make the ADF think that the signal is coming from a different location. This effect is most pronounced during sunrise and sunset, when the ionosphere is changing. Sometimes the night effect can also allow NDB signals to propagate such long distances that they cause interference with another NDB on the same frequency.",

However, based on the information provided in the question (RMI Deviation), we can infer that the RMI readings will be relative to Compass North. Given that the ADF is tuned to an NDB, the ADF needle on the RMI works as follows: The Tip of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing to the NDB (300°). The Tail of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing from the NDB (120°). In this case, we assume that the RMI is subjected to electromagnetic interference and therefore, deviation is applied: -2ºW (westerly deviation) ⇒ Compass North is 2° West of Magnetic North. Let’s start by converting compass heading to magnetic heading: Deviation west, compass best; Deviation east, compass least Magnetic Bearing to the NDB = Compass Bearing to the NDB - 002° = 300° - 002° = 298° Since the question asks for true bearing, we need to correct for magnetic variation: Variation west, magnetic best; Variation east, magnetic least. Remember that for NDB/ADF bearings the bearings are taken at the aircraft, therefore the magnetic variation applicable at the aircraft's position is to be used: Variation at the DR position = 22° West ⇒ Magnetic North is 22° West of True North True Bearing to the NDB = Magnetic Bearing to the NDB - 022° = 298° - 022° = 276°",

This accuracy is particularly noticeable when the aircraft is at a low altitude and relatively far away from the DME station, within the line of sight. In this example, the pilot is following a DME arc during an approach procedure. Therefore, the pilot keeps a constant DME read-out in order to remain on the arc (i.e. 15 DME arc). This means that DME measured by the aircraft is not changing, and the rate of change in the detected distance from the station is zero.

Displayed DME time-to-station may not count all the way down to zero as you fly over the station. The DME range (slant range) can be calculated using the following formula: True Range = √ ( Slant range 2 – Aircraft height 2 ) NOTE: Range and Height must be in same units e.g. Nautical Miles! In our case: 1 NM = 6 080 ft 6 000 ft correspond at 0.99 NM True Range = √ ( Slant range 2 – Aircraft height 2 ) True Range = √ (52 – 0.99 2 ) True Range = √ (25– 0.98 2 ) True Range = √ 24.02 True Range = 4.9 NM",

            "explanation": "This question has given us two locations with coordinates, and these can be drawn out if necessary. With these types of questions, you must look for which coordinates are the same. In this case, the 98ºE longitude is the same for both, meaning that the aircraft and the VOR/DME are on the same meridian. Looking at the coordinates again, the aircraft is directly south (True South) of the beacon. The question asks for the direction the aircraft must fly for the DME groundspeed readout to read correctly. As the DME groundspeed readout uses \"rate of change of DME distance\" as the method for calculating groundspeed, then the only way for it to read correctly is by flying directly towards or directly away from the DME. Technically, going directly away slightly reduces the errors due to slant distance vs ground distance, as the aircraft is getting further from the DME, which is more accurate. This does not affect this question though, as the radial is the same one no matter which direction we fly along it. As the aircraft is directly True South from the beacon, then the radial that the aircraft would be flying on is whatever is True South of the VOR, so we must simply work out what magnetic radial corresponds to True South at the beacon. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 167º 13ºE (+) 180 We need to use the variation at the VOR as that is where the radial directions were decided, and emitted. Therefore, the aircraft must fly along radial 167º",

VDF bearing information will only be given when conditions are satisfactory and radio bearings fall within the calibrated limits of the station. There are 4 factors that affect the accuracy of a VDF: Propagation error and site error cause by aircraft’s transmissions being reflected from terrain as they travel to the site, or being reflected from buildings at the site. Aircraft attitude, the VDF system and VHF communications are vertically polarized, therefore the most accurate is when the aircraft flies straight and level. Poor accuracy is likely in the overhead of a VDF receiver. The reception of both direct wave and ground reflected wave can cause signal fading or loss. Together with other multi path signals this gives rise to bearing errors. Transmissions done at the same time by two or more aircraft will cause momentary errors in bearings.",

The deviation detection of the aircraft from the desired track is based on two different overlapping lobes. These lobes are radiated by both the localiser and the glide path antennas. These consist of a 90 Hz lobe and a 150 Hz lobe. For the glide path: When the airborne receiver receives a stronger signal from the 90 Hz lobe than the 150 Hz lobe, it means that the aircraft is above the ‘ideal’ glideslope. When the airborne receiver receives a stronger signal from the 150 Hz lobe than the 90 Hz lobe, the aircraft will be below the ‘ideal’ glideslope. When both signals are received at the same strength it means the aircraft will be on the ‘ideal’ glideslope and the glideslope needle will indicate zero. Assume that you are on the centreline, if you move away from the centrelline/ideal glide slope the DDM will increase. DDM = AM (90 hz) - AM (150 hz) / 100 Therefore, once you go off centreline/ideal glide slope, either the 90 or 150 increases, causing DDM to increase (negative is also assumed to be an increase).",

This is because the direction of the incoming beam matters to their accuracy by their very nature, and is much less accurate if it has been \"reflected\" off the ionosphere.

In general we can affirm that there is a difference between Ground Range and Slant Range but that difference is negligible and not worth considering until you are VERY close to the beacon, at which point plotting becomes quite immaterial and difficult owing to the relatively rapid changes in distance, i.e. 3 NM change in range is not significant when 150 NM from the beacon but it is significant when you are only 5 NM from the beacon. As a rule of thumb, discrepancies only start to appear within 1 NM per 1,000' of height, e.g. when flying at 10,000' the discrepancies only start to appear within 10 NM, at 20,000 within 20 NM, etc. Even then, they are very small and hardly worth worrying about, e.g. at 35,000' 35 NM Ground Distance = 35.6 NM DME Distance, and 10 NM Gnd Dist = 12 NM DME Dist. Note: In case you’ll find one of these two questions in our exam, the suggestion is to write a report explaining that ICAO Annex 10 does not contain a decisive definition and we have been unable to locate one anywhere, apart from the CASA publication which itself does not state 'SLANT' range but states 'DME' range, although these are popularly held to be the same.",

The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“• - • - • - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“• • • • •”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white)",

The first one provides information about how far an aircraft is horizontally from the correct inbound course, called azimuth guidance (similar to ILS localiser). The second one provides similar information about how far the aircraft is from the correct glide path, called elevation guidance. There is a third transmitter that is used to allow curved and segmented MLS procedures to take place also, called the DME/P, which is a more precise version of a standard DME. With this in use also, the aircraft can have the knowledge of its 3-dimensional position for much more complex (not straight-in) approaches. The azimuth and elevation transmitters work in the same way, they emit a beam that \"scans\" the sky, side-to-side (to and fro) for the azimuth guidance, up-and-down for the elevation beam. The aircraft then detects how much time passed inbetween the beams being detected, (between the \"to\" and the \"fro\" beam, for instance), and can very accurately detect its angular distance from the inbound course/glide path. The azimuth beam does not constantly scan to-fro-to-fro., but has a break whilst the elevation beam does it's own scan, and they alternate with each other. (with data being passed also through the frequency at set intervals).",

Reflectivity Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echoes appear on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. => Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence and wind shear directly, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water. In more modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence. => This function (the TURB function) is based on the Doppler effect and is sensitive to precipitation movement. The TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM (Doppler measurement capability) and should only be used in wet turbulence. The mention of Doppler techniques makes this the correct answer immediately. This very useful function can provide inputs that are computed alongside the Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs) and the air data computer to provide localised windshear warnings, which are then usually annunciated by the EGPWS system.",

The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Usually, this blocking return is a very heavy cumulonimbus cloud, full of large rain and hail.",

This is the \"mapping\" mode, and the AWR actually has a separate beam transmission pattern that is best suited to receive accurate ground returns.

The transmissions are achieved in the UHF band where all ground interrogation pulses are processed at a 1 030 MHz carrier frequency and all transponder responses are completed on the 1 090 MHz carrier channel. The two main modes of operation (excluding Mode S) are: Mode A. An interrogation to identify an aircraft. Mode C. An interrogation to obtain an aumatic height read-out of an aircraft. Three pulses (P1, P2 and P3) are always transmitted to diferentiate between interrogations. The spacing between P1 and P2 is fixed at at 2 μs. The spacing between P1 and P3 is 8 μs for a Mode A and 21 μs for a Mode C interrogation. The transponder detects the time interval between the pulses P1 and P3 that determines the mode of interrogation.",

Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) work by transmitting microwave pulses forwards from the aircraft, in a standard sweeping radar pattern, then waiting for any reflected pulses to return, measuring the time taken to return, and plotting the position of the reflector (raindrops, hail, suspended water in a cloud of all types - some better reflectors than others) on the screen. The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Here we can see that the very intense cell above aerodrome A is blocking the vast majority of returns in a corridor of shadow behind it. Therefore, Aerodrome B's precipitation is unknown. Aerodrome C, however, is not shadowed by a huge cell, and the low intensity green cell in front of it is not enough to block the majority of the pulses. \"Fly straight ahead\" Incorrect. If the pilots continue straight ahead, they will come across an area of intense activity. \"Fly straight ahead to avoid A, turn left to B and then go back on course.\" and \"Direct to B and then go back on course.\" Incorrect. \"A\" is a very intense cell which is blocking the weather behind it. \"Direct to C and then go back to course.\" Correct. Turning to \"C\" seems to be the safest option.",

The spacing between P1 and P2 is fixed at at 2 μs. This causes the P2 polar to be superimposed onto the pulse pair signal. The only time the P2 signal strength is smaller than that of P1 and P3, the signal is received in the main lobe. Reception in the sidelobe results in a higher signal strength of P2. The receiver compares the magnitude of the pulses and if the P2 pulse is larger than the interrogation pulse, the response is denied. Therefore, it only replies to interrogation by the main beam - this is called Side Lobe Suppression (SLS). If the combined P2 signal is stronger => aircraft in a side lobe. If the combined P2 signal is smaller => aircraft in a main lobe.",

One of the primary tasks of an AWR system is to detect upcoming turbulence and bad weather, so that the pilots can take necessary precautions or avoiding action. The largest areas of turbulence come from cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, which contain large droplets of water, ice crystals, and hail stones. Modern AWRs are set up to have a wavelength of approximately 3cm, so they bounce off these types of precipitation the most. The radars have been tuned this way to make sure that more radar returns means that there is a higher chance of turbulence in that area. Usually, the bigger the hail/droplets, the worse the turbulence. The radar pulses will always reflect off wet hail and large water droplets better than they will off smaller water droplets, dry hail and ice crystals.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self-stabilising at a particular attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, then reduced during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (such as developing thunderstorms) that could affect the aircraft. It should be kept low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display.",

Whilst the learning objectives do not specify the frequency band of airborne weather radars, it is a very common question, and the answer is that AWRs operate in the SHF band (Super High Frequency). This can also be calculated using the formula; speed of light = frequency x wavelength rearranged is; frequency = speed of light / wavelength frequency = 3x108 (m/s) / 0.03 (m) = 1x1010 (Hz) The frequency is therefore around 10 GHz, which is between 3 and 30 GHz, and is therefore in the SHF band, as shown in the annex above. As it turns out, the exact wavelength used is 3.2 cm and therefore the selected frequency for AWR is 9.375 GHz (9375 MHz). AWR must be optimised not to detect very small particles such as thin fog but to accurately identify rain and hail particles within storms. Too small wavelengths will result in reflection from very small particles. Larger wavelengths result in the waves bending around particles of interest.",

Airborne Weather Radars have 2 main functions, weather detection and ground mapping. Pilots look ahead using their AWR to pick the a route using areas of best weather and least turbulence. Turbulence can be detected by modern AWRs, but not ALL areas of turbulence, as CAT (clear air turbulence) has no associated particles which can reflect radar pulses; it is invisible by definition. Standard turbulence within clouds can be detected, as the movement of the precipitation within the cloud causes a doppler shift on the returning radar pulses, so the radar can form an idea of the air movement patterns in that area. If they are erratic, then turbulence exists in that region. This question is not referring to the mapping mode. For one, the mapping mode has been used for over 70 years, so is not only used in \"modern\" weather radars. Also, the mapping is not very good at displaying mountainous terrain, and would never be used for such applications. It would also be very difficult to navigate via ground feagtures using it over the clouds, as the clouds would reflect many pulses, making it innacurate.",

Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions.

            "explanation": "Power is defined as the rate of energy transfer per second. The higher power an antenna is, the stronger its signals, and therefore the further the signals will be able to travel before being fully absorbed by the atmosphere. A pulse radar fires a pulse for a short time, then waits a much longer time to look for any reflected signals from any potential objects in its path. We do not want to measure the radar’s power when it is waiting, as there is no power output during that time. This is why we measure the energy emitted over the period of the pulse width only, and then we can average that power over the pulse width to find the power of the radar pulse. The big problem with this question is that there are two answers which are correct. As the radar fires a pulse of near enough continuous energy (for that short time), the peak power can be referred to as the pulse power, as they are usually the same value. This is the same as \"power measured over the period of the pulse width\", as a radar pulse should produce a continuous amount of power during the pulse width. The big thing to remember is that the average power output of the radar is much less than the pulse power (peak power), as this value has then been averaged out over the whole pulse cycle, which is mostly filled with no power output (see annex above). Note: There has been recent feedback from two authorities that the correct answer is \"peak pulse power\", but if the option \"power measured over the period of the pulse width\" also appears, then an appeal (and certainly a comment - if possible) could be made, as we believe this is an equally correct answer. Any exam feedback on this would also be useful, thank you.",

The tilt depends on the flight altitude and the altitude of the next flight phase. In mountainous regions, for instance, high peaks may trigger the AWR to show solid echoes even though they are produced by the ground. For this reason, when the aircraft descends to a lower altitude, a higher tilt setting is more beneficial to avoid reflections from the ground (\"ground clutter\").

Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. For example, a water particle is five times more reflective than an ice particle of the same size. Good returns are ensured on heavy rain-bearing clouds (cumulus type). However, poor responses are expected from light rain/fog (such as stratus type).",

            "explanation": "Airborne Weather Radar is a type of radar used to provide an indication to pilots of the intensity of convective weather. Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. It needs to be noted that the frequency band of the radio waves (X band) is selected not to detect any cloud, small precipitation such as drizzle, fog or wind, as the droplets are too little or don’t exist. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear. * Green: light precipitation, slight turbolence * Yellow (or amber): medium precipitation,light turbolence * Red: heavy precipitation, medium to severe turbolence * Magenta: Extremely high precipitation, severe turbolence Conventional weather radar cannot detect wind speed or turbulence directly, it only detects solid and liquid objects above a threshold size. The most turbulent areas of thunderstorms are also those areas that contain the most water and ice. Note that the areas in which the concentration of droplets decreases rapidly (which are marked on the radar screen by a sharp fall in signal intensity) are normally areas in which the most severe turbulence can be encountered. These are areas in which the strong up-going air currents are in close proximity to downward flowing currents and there is a strong risk of severe vertical wind shear. These areas will be identified on the radar screen by a rapid change in appearance of the cloud return - steep change in colors of the return (steep color gradient). If you identify this area on your radar screen, avoid that area! So the weather radar is merely detecting the presence of water. It is the pilot interpreting the picture who is really detecting the turbulence. Clear air turbulence (CAT) does not have condensated water in it and is therefore undetectable by conventional radar. There are systems such as LIDAR that can detect CAT but they generally not installed on aircraft.",

A typical four-color system will be green, yellow, red and magenta, with magenta being the most severe. Sometimes, magenta is reserved for turbulence, depending on the manufacturer and setting.

            "explanation": "Airborne weather radar is a type of radar used to provide an indication to pilots of the intensity of convective weather. Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Airborne weather radar is typically Xband, pulse modulated and operating in the 8-12 Ghz range (wavelenght approx. 3 cm). The shape of the radar beam is very important in the design of a radar. For purposes of airborne weather radar, a narrow beam is the most desirable because it concentrates more energy on the target, which means more energy will come back in the echo. Flat Plate antennas are better than dish antennas and larger antennas are better than smaller antennas for concentrating the beam. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a radar will determine its maximum range. The PRF must be long enough to allow the echo pulses to return from the maximum range target. The longer the required range, the lower the PRF Scanning speed comes into play with the PRF since a high scanning speed and low PRF would cause targets to be missed. At least one pulse should be transmitted per a beam width of scan. Pulse width will determine the minimum range of the radar and also the resolution size of the target. If a target is close and the echo is reflected back to the radar while the transmitter pulse is still being transmitted, then obviously that target will be missed. Most radars I have worked with had a pulse width of less than 4 microseconds so this isn’t a problem. Also, many radars will shorten their pulse width in map mode allowing a higher degree of resolution for ground targets such as shorelines or islands.",

            "explanation": "PRF ( Pulse Recurrence Frequency ) is the number of pulses trasmitted in a second. PRF is one of the main factors that determine the maximum theoretical unambiguous range of a pulse radar. The trasmitter must remain “silent” while the receiver is “listening” for echoes. If the design maximum range is 200NM the receiver must be allowed to “listen” for the period of time fro when a pulse has been trasmitted untill it can go to 200NM and than return. That is a round trip of 400 NM, which would require a longer “silent period” than a radar whit a range of 100NM where the pulses have to travel only 200NM. Therefore we can say that a lower PRF enables a longer maximum theoretical range: max therorical range is inversly proportional to the PRF. The following formula may be used to calculate the max theoretical unambiguous range : Range (in Km) = 300 000 ÷ ( PRF x 2 ), or if we need to find the required PRF based on a specific unambiguous range needed, we can rearrange the formula: PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( Range (in Km) x 2) In our case we can apply the second one. 1 NM = 1.852 km so 200 x 1.852 = 370.4 Km PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( 370.4 x 2 ) PRF = 404.97 pps = approx. 405 pps",

Instead of waiting for pulse reflections, SSR sends out specific interrogations to aircraft SSR transponders. These interrogations are transmitted at a frequency of 1030 MHz. In response, the aircraft transponder emits its own series of reply pulses on a separate frequency of 1090 MHz. This causes SSR range to increase due to the active participation of the airborne equipment, since only a quarter of the power is required to travel half the distance. So with the same power output, an increased range can be achieved. In Mode A the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. In Mode C the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting Mode S are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

Mode S transponders are a natural continuation of the Mode A and Mode C transponders. The mode A transponder is able to sent a 4 digit squawk code, of which there are only 4096 individual identities, Mode S can handle 16 million different ICAO 24 bit aircraft addresses (AAs). These AAs are unique addresses registered to a particular aircraft. There is also a much larger ability for transfer of information through mode S, with many different aircraft parameters able to be transferred to the ground through ELS (elementary surveillance) or EHS (enhanced surveillance) systems, and even a capacity of communications via datalink. Mode S transponders use the same frequencies as Mode A/C transponders, so are backwards compatible, and the SSR ground station produces different interrogation pulses to require a response from a particular mode S transponder (or can \"all-call\" mode S transponders). The Mode S transponder also receives information from TCAS interrogations from nearby aircraft, and replies with information such as range, bearing and altitude to aid TCAS separation. Mode S transponders are key to TCAS operation, and are very closely linked. The other options in these answers could not be correct. In primary radar, there is a reflection, not a reply. ADS-B is a system which relies on un-requested output signals from the aircraft's transponder, called squitters. These squitters also aid TCAS identification.",

The system's effectiveness depends on the moisture content and size of the precipitation, with wetter and larger precipitation yielding more favorable reflectivity and stronger radar returns. Notably, radar returns are most robust when encountering wet hail, while radar returns from ice crystals and dry snow tend to be less distinct. On the radar display, stronger returns typically appear as red, while weaker returns are depicted in green, and yellow represents returns of intermediate strength. Magenta colour may be used to indicate areas of turbulence. The Airborne Weather Radar (AWR) system autonomously maintains a specific attitude by utilizing the IRS (Inertial Reference System) attitude system. Consequently, it remains unaffected by changes in the aircraft's pitch. Moreover, the AWR system offers flexibility in setting various vertical tilt angles, allowing the flight crew to tailor its functionality to their requirements. Recommended tilt settings are: high tilt at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into reduced tilt during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (i.e. developing thunderstorms) low tilt in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around the aircraft tilt raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns",

Activating the turbulence mode means the radar will not just be looking at where the return pulses come from and their distance, but also any frequency shift in the returning pulse. If the frequency has changed, then the thing the pulse bounced off must itself be moving - which in turn, implies movement of the air, and turbulence.

The benefit of the squawk \"IDENT\" function is a manual identification of the aircraft. The controller may ask via the radio communication frequency to \"IDENT\" in case of any doubt of identification on the controller's display. Upon acquisition of the SPI pulse, the indication of that aircraft begins to flash on the display of the controller. This produces a distinctive display so that a controller can pick out a particular aircraft by asking the pilot to “Squawk Ident”.

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The thin pencil beam of the radar scans the area ahead of the aircraft horizontally, and the pilots can choose to manually adjust the vertical tilt of the beam. This can be used to detect the tops (or even bases) of clouds, given a small diagram and a basic knowledge of trigonometry. The AWR will only display returns when it is pointed at an area containing precipitation, in this case a storm cloud. When we tilt the radar beam high enough, it will no longer see the cloud, at which point the returns in that area of the screen will stop, and this is the angle between the aircraft and the top of the cloud. Given that we know the range from the storm, which is already on our AWR display, we can calculate the relative height of the top of the cloud, and therefore the approximate altitude of the top, using the following formula: Cloud Tops = Range(ft) x (Radar Tilt Angle -1/2 Beam Width)",

Please let us know if you get this question in an exam, as the current feedback is limited and we would like to verify it, thank you! Whilst this is a bit of an odd question, it is answerable. an aircraft's altitude can be expressed a few different ways in flight. It could be expressed as height, either over the terrain (using radio altimeter) or over an airport (using the airport QFE pressure setting). It can be expressed in altitude, using a QNH pressure setting from a nearby airport or the regional pressure setting. It can also be expressed as a flight level, which is when the altimeter is set to standard pressure (1013.25 hPa), whilst above the transition layer. In this question, for whatever reason, the student pilot has set 1013.2 hPa in their altimeter subscale before departure, this means that they will be receiving height information in the form of pressure altitude, or their \"flight level\" (when divided by 100, from ft to FL). Some may argue that they could just be setting the airport's QNH, and therefore the altimeter would read out their \"altitude\", this is not the case, as a QNH value is never decimal, only ever a whole number (and is always rounded down for safety), so 1013.2 hPa must be for the standard pressure setting.",

There is therefore a two-way communication, unlike the echo principle. The Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) has several advantages over the primary radar. The major advantage being less power is required for the aerial. Since the minimum transmission power requirement is based on the distance to the aircraft, power echo creation is not necessary. The transmission completed by the transponder also results in stronger signals compared to the primary radar, meaning that the receiver sensitivity may be lower. These two factors combined lead to a smaller aerial requirement with lower installation costs.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR): The radar antenna rotates (usually at 5-12 rpm) emits a pulse of radio wave. Upon reaching an aircraft (or other object) the wave is reflected and some of the energy is returned to the antenna. The PSR output data uses polar coordinate system: it provides range and bearing of the targets found in respect of the antenna position. Note that the range is the slant distance from the antenna and not the horizontal distance. The range is determined by the time difference of the emitted and received pulse (the speed of propagation is the speed of light) and the bearing is obtained from the antenna azimuth. The rotation speed of the antenna is usually between 5 and 12 rpm. The antenna radiation patern is a narrow beam when seen from above and, whith some approximation, can be considered as a trapezium if seen from the side. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) requires an airborne transponder which responds to the receipt of a pulse from a ground-based antenna by transmitting a return signal. Because the transponder transmits a much stronger signal than that which is reflected off an aircraft in primary radar systems, reater range and reliability can be achieved with secondary radar and cheaper and more efficient ground equipment can be used. Additionally, information such as altitude and a code can be added to the returned signal from the transponder which is then displayed on the operator’s screen. In Mode A the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. The code system is octal; that is, each of the code digits may be any of the numbers 0-7. There are thus 4096 possible four-digit codes. In Mode C the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting Mode S are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. This reduces problems of garbling between SSR returns from aircraft in close proximity. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

That is why all large aircraft are equipped with an airborne weather radar. The Airborne Weather Radar (AWR) system fitted on large aircraft uses a primary radar system to look for reflections from precipitation in clouds. The wetter and larger the precipitation, the better the reflectivity, the stronger the returns. Wet hail gives the best returns, whereas ice crystals and dry snow do not give good radar returns. Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence). Convective weather has bigger, wetter precipitation, which makes for stronger radar returns. The Radar works the same as any other pulse radar, by pointing in a particular direction and firing off a pulse of electromagnetic radiation (in the microwave band), then waiting for a reply from any potential reflections in that area. It then measures the time of arrival of the reflection, and uses this to calculate the distance from the target (as the pulses travel at the speed of light). Collision detection such as TCAS is usually provided through secondary radar, with pulses and replies, rather than reflections.",

Any further exam feedback would be very useful, and can be put directly in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. The slotted planar array was developed to reduce the reflectivity and the side-lobes associated with parabolic antennas. Slotted planar array antennas use a flat receiver (compared to the concave receiver of a parabolic antenna) with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, so that the reflected radar energy is gathered in a more efficient way. The advantage of such a radar is that there is less energy lost through sidelobes and a narrower beam (typically 3º rather than 5º with older systems). The annex above is a slotter planar array, which would then be mounted in the nose cone of an aircraft (sometimes under the wing for large single engine aircraft). Almost all airborne weather radars have a mapping mode, and in the past it was a very useful tool for navigation, especially when it comes to navigating around the regions of coastlines. These days, it is not nearly as well used, as the common use of moving maps and GNSS/FMS navigation have made it a little unnecessary. AWR mapping can be done by simply tilting the AWR downwards towards the ground, but it produces quite a broken/cluttered display of terrain. The better way to do it in the past was to use a cosecant squared beam, which is a different radiation pattern to the standard pencil beam used for picking up weather returns. The cosecant squared beam uses different amounts of pulses in different directions to prioritise the ground better than the pencil beam, and allows for a better (less broken) view of the ground ahead. The AWR does still need to be tilted downwards from the horizontal for this to work, but on some systems the use of the \"MAP\" mode will do that automatically. Weather radars point forwards (and a certain degree left and right of the nose) so are not omnidirectional.",

The 4 answers below should each be individually explained; SELCAL - SELCAL is the shortened form of \"selective calling\", which is used by ATC to inform a particular aircraft to begin monitoring the frequency. It is primarily used for communication over long distances, when HF radio is in use. It allows an aircraft to turn the radio down and not listen so intently on frequency to the potentially bad HF signal, as the aircraft will get an indication when ATC are trying to reach them. It uses a 4 digit code which is entered on the flight plan, and does not require any such \"log on\". CPDLC - Controller-Pilot Data-Link Communications. This is a method of using datalink to establish text based communications between the aircraft and ATC. It does require a log on phase - also known as the notification phase - which allows identification to take place, and the aircraft to be connected to the network. D-ATIS - Digital ATIS or Data-link ATIS, This is a broadcast that our aircraft can pick up, which gives a text-based readout of the standard ATIS at an aerodrome. It does not require a log on, and any suitably equipped aircraft can pick it up. ADS-B - Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast, This is a system which broadcasts an aircraft's position (along with many other pieces of information) to other aircraft and to ATC. As this is the B type of ADS, meaning broadcast, the aircraft will continuously output information bursts known as \"squitters\", and any suitably equipped ADS-in aircraft or controller will be able to receive this information.

It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth.

It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING Bearing measurement in radar systems utilizes the searchlight principle, where radio pulses are focused into narrow beams. This can be achieved by reducing the wavelength or electronically enlarging the antenna in advanced systems. The narrow beam is then rotated at a consistent speed. By analyzing the direction of the received echo, the bearing of the object can be determined based on the azimuth of the antenna at the time of receiving the echo.

Learning Objective 062.03.01.01.01: Name the different applications of radar with respect to air traffic control (ATC), weather observations, and airborne weather radar (AWR). RADAR is an incredibly useful tool to aviation, and is used in many forms, for multiple different jobs in civil aviation. For starters, it is split into primary and secondary radar. Primary radar is where a transceiver sends out electromagnetic pulses or waves that are reflected off items in the environment, back to the transceiver, and the time taken to travel to and from the object is measured, to give an indication of its range. The radar scans back and forth to figure out the direction of the object, and in doing so, gets a direction and distance, so can plot the location on a display. Secondary radar is where an interrogator sends out an interrogation signal, transponders pick this signal up, then send a reply signal, which is good as it can carry more information, such as squawk codes and altitudes, as used in SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar). ATC can use primary radar to track aircraft and weather, and use secondary radar also to track aircraft and gain extra information about an aircraft (SSR). Pilots can use primary radar to track weather and navigate (Airborne Weather Radar) as well as in the radio altimeter, and can use secondary radar to detect other aircraft for collision avoidance (ACAS/TCAS), as well as for DME (which is technically a secondary radar system, the aircraft is the interrogator).",

This is simply the direction the antenna is pointing when it receives the radar return. Therefore, the answer is \"the orientation of the antenna\". Radars work by sending out pulses of electromagnetic waves and timing when they get returns back that have reflect off certain objects. This allows them to calculate how far away the object is, and by spinning continuously and sending out a new pulse in each direction, they can work out where the object is in relation to the radar antenna, by both direction and distance. As for the other options: The pulse pair interval is set by the radar designer to choose the maximum range of the radar (how long does it wait for a return before sending the next pulse). The frequency shift of the received pulse can be used to calculate the speed of the object relative to the antenna (only towards or away from the antenna) due to doppler shift. This is used in some primary ground radar systems, but more often for pilots, we use this in airborne weather radars to spot areas of windshear. The time measurement is what allows the radar to work out how far away the object is, so is half of the data needed to plot the object's position (distance + direction).",

            "explanation": "Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. It needs to be noted that the frequency band of the radio waves (X band) is selected not to detect any cloud, small precipitation such as drizzle, fog or wind, as the droplets are too little or don’t exist. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear. Weather radars send directional pulses of microwave radiation, on the order of a microsecond long, using a cavity magnetron or klystron tube connected by a waveguide to a parabolic antenna. The wavelengths of 1 – 10 cm are approximately ten times the diameter of the droplets or ice particles of interest, because Rayleigh scattering occurs at these frequencies. This means that part of the energy of each pulse will bounce off these small particles, back in the direction of the radar station. Shorter wavelengths are useful for smaller particles, but the signal is more quickly attenuated. Thus 10 cm (S-band) radar is preferred but is more expensive than a 5 cm C-band system. 3 cm X-band radar is used only for short-range units, and 1 cm Ka-band weather radar is used only for research on small-particle phenomena such as drizzle and fog W band weather radar systems have seen limited university use, but due to quicker attenuation, most data are not operational. Radar pulses spread out as they move away from the radar station. Thus the volume of air that a radar pulse is traversing is larger for areas farther away from the station, and smaller for nearby areas, decreasing resolution at far distances. At the end of a 150 – 200 km sounding range, the volume of air scanned by a single pulse might be on the order of a cubic kilometer. This is called the pulse volume.",

Manual Tilt Management The tilt refers to the angle between the antenna beam centreline and the horizon. The flight crew should regularly scan the area ahead of the aircraft. In order to identify the strongest weather returns, the flight crew should tilt the weather radar antenna up and down. To obtain a correct display of a storm cell, the flight crew must use the tilt knob to point the weather radar beam to the most reflective part of the storm cell. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. We believe this is the point they want to get across in this question. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

            "explanation": "The radar can has two modes, weather and mapping. The weather beam is used for detecting clouds and is a conical pencil beam with a width of 5 degrees and the mapping is for ground features and uses a fan shaped or cosecant squared beam. The directional properties of the radar produce side lobes. One side lobe goes vertically down to the ground and is received back by the weather radar receiver. This received signal produces a height ring on the display. The ring indicates that the radar is working and appears at the approximate height of the aeroplane above the gound. An aeroplane flying at 12000ft will have a permanent return at approximately 2nm. Weather radars produce a wide fan shaped beam (cosecant square beam) by placing parasitic elements in front of the radar dish to deflect the beam. It is also referred to as the spoil beam. The Cosecant square beam provides a wider coverage than the conical beam at short range and its transmission pattern has the effect of compensating for range by sending more power to the top part of the beam which hits more distant objects. The cosec beam works out to between 60NM and 150NM (depending on type!! This is probably an old question that’s why the correct answer is “from 50NM to 60 NM” only). Beyond that range there is not enough power in the beam to produce reasonable returns so the more concentrated conical beam should be used instead in the weather mode. The radar display of ground returns does not always look like the terrain would look like on a map. Hills can cause \"shadowing\" at low altitude, masking the terrain behind them and giving a false impression of water. In arctic regions returns from ice can mask the true shape of the coastline.",

Range control of the ND: this has an essential influence on the optimum tilt setting. Gain control: this adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. Radar modes: weather (WX) or weather + turbulence (WX + T). Source: safetyfirst.airbus.com/ The \"gain\" of a radar adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. A high gain (high sensitivity) means that even very small reflected pulses will show up as returns on the radar screen, but this means that the radar screen can easily get too cluttered with very small returns that we do not want to see. A low gain will make the radar less sensitive, and so only large returns will actually show up on the display. Changing the gain also changes the sensitivity of the different colour bands, which is very useful. The gain can be changed in flight, for instance when looking at a cumulus cloud that does not look too violent, we might be happy to proceed through it if we know which bits are worst within it. With standard gain, the whole cloud might be green, but with the gain set a little higher, it may be possible to see the worst patches within it. The same goes for a thunderstorm that is huge and all red on the display, reducing the gain can give more detail about the weather within.",

The most turbulent areas of thunderstorms are also those areas that contain the most water and ice. Note that the areas in which the concentration of droplets decreases rapidly (which are marked on the radar screen by a sharp fall in signal intensity) are normally areas in which the most severe turbulence can be encountered. These are areas in which the strong up-going air currents are in close proximity to downward flowing currents and there is a strong risk of severe vertical wind shear. These areas will be identified on the radar screen by a rapid change in appearance of the cloud return - steep change in colors of the return (steep color gradient). If you identify this area on your radar screen, avoid that area! * Green: light precipitation, slight turbolence * Yellow (or amber): medium precipitation,light turbolence * Red: heavy precipitation, medium to severe turbolence * Magenta: Extremely high precipitation, severe turbolence So the weather radar is merely detecting the presence of water. It is the pilot interpreting the picture who is really detecting the turbulence. Clear air turbulence (CAT) does not have condensated water in it and is therefore undetectable by conventional radar. There are systems such as LIDAR that can detect CAT but they generally not installed on aircraft.",

The pilot may manually transmit a Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse when the \"IDENT\" button on the pilot's transponder is pressed. By pushing the “IDENT” button, the transponder transmits an additional pulse at the end of the normal response pulse train. The benefit of the squawk \"IDENT\" function is a manual identification of the aircraft. The controller may ask via the radio communication frequency to \"IDENT\" in case of any doubt of identification on the controller display. Upon acquisition of the SPI pulse, the transponder indication changes/begins to flash on the controller's radar display for approximately 20 seconds.

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) works on the pulse technique and echo principle which used electromagnetic waves to detect objects and detect their returning echoes. It provides bearing and distance information of detected objects. The radar relies on reflected signals but is not aware if they are received from aircraft or from other objects (e.g. terrain, buildings, clouds). Such reflections are called clutter. Moving Target Indicator (MTI) technology is able to eliminate echoes from stationary objects such as terrain, buildings, etc. while leaving only relevant information displayed on the screen (aircraft). A target is therefore discriminated against clutter. MTI takes advantage of the Doppler effect: A moving target will be at different distance from the radar over a period of time. The reflection of radar pulses from a moving target will therefore occur at a varying distance with time - each successive pulse will be reflected from a different distance to the radar. The result will be a varying phase shift of the pulses due to a doppler effect. Stationary objects will reflect pulses at a constant phase shift.",

Manual Tilt Management The tilt refers to the angle between the antenna beam centreline and the horizon. The flight crew should regularly scan the area ahead of the aircraft. In order to identify the strongest weather returns, the flight crew should tilt the weather radar antenna up and down. To obtain a correct display of a storm cell, the flight crew must use the tilt knob to point the weather radar beam to the most reflective part of the storm cell. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. We believe this is the point they want to get across in this question. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

If we climb higher (perhaps to overfly the storm), then that same tilt setting will be looking higher up within the storm, and will be seeing the ice crystals, rather than the wet hail and large water droplets. This is why we would set the tilt further downwards after making such a climb. It is important to remember that there are other questions asking about the tilt setting during take-off and climb out. Well of course, the setting at that time of flight would be quite high, to see the weather the aircraft is climbing towards and avoid clutter from ground returns. After that, though, the tilt setting should gradually be reduced until the cruise, and then in the descent, gradually increased again to avoid ground returns. Remember also that the radar is automatically stabilised so it follows the horizon plus/minus any tilt, not the aircraft attitude plus/minus tilt.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

The tilt depends on the flight altitude and the altitude of the next flight phase. In mountainous regions, for instance, high peaks may trigger the AWR to show solid echoes even though they are produced by the ground.

Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! RADAR is an incredibly useful tool to aviation, and is used in many forms, for multiple different jobs in civil aviation. For starters, it is split into primary and secondary radar. Primary radar is where a transceiver sends out electromagnetic pulses or waves that are reflected off items in the environment, back to the transceiver, and the time taken to travel to and from the object is measured, to give an indication of its range. The radar scans back and forth to figure out the direction of the object, and in doing so, gets a direction and distance, so can plot the location on a display. Secondary radar is where an interrogator sends out an interrogation signal, transponders pick this signal up, then send a reply signal, which is good as it can carry more information, such as squawk codes and altitudes, as used in SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar). Aircraft are fitted with a primary radar to track weather and navigate (Airborne Weather Radar) as well as in the radio altimeter, and can use secondary radar to detect other aircraft for collision avoidance (ACAS/TCAS), as well as for DME (which is technically a secondary radar system, the aircraft is the interrogator). For this question, we are just talking about primary radar, so TCAS and SSR are not correct options, and the only correct option is weather radar, which is a common item to have on board a commercial aircraft. Radio altimeters are also primary radars fitted to an aircraft, but none of the options correspond to that. Weather radars can also show terrain nearby in a way, but this is not their primary purpose at all, and is very rarely used these days.",

Therefore, SSR systems have a greater range than PSR systems, on the order of 250+ NM from the radar site. In addition, unlike PSR, which relies on reflected pulses, SSR's operation is not affected by ground interference due to its unique transmission and reception methods. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR An airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. AWR detects drops of precipitation such as rain and wet hail. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

It refers to a system which emits pulses of electromagnetic energy, then waits for any of those pulses to return, and if/when they do, it measures the time between emitting the pulse and receiving the reflected pulse, which it can then use to calculate the distance from the target, as the electromagnetic waves all travel at the speed of light. It does this whilst scanning the sky from side to side, so each pulse targets a different area of the sky horizontally, and by sending pulses many hundreds of times per second, the radar can scan the region and get both a bearing and a distance to each target. This can then be plotted on a display for the radar operator to see. With primary radar, you can therefore only see locations of targets, and can extrapolate their movements over time to get a rough idea of their speed, if the operator is skilled. Other radar systems can provide more information than this (SSR - Secondary Surveillance Radar), which use a different method of radar operation",

It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth. RANGE The range is determined by comparing the time it takes for the pulse to be emitted and received, utilizing the speed of light as the propagation speed. It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING The measurement of bearing is achieved using the searchlight principle. This involves concentrating radio pulses into narrow beams, which can be accomplished by either shortening the wavelength or increasing the size of the aerial (in advanced systems, this is done electronically). The narrow beam is then rotated at a constant speed. When an echo is received, the direction of the object is determined based on the direction of the beam at the time of receiving the echo. This direction is measured from a fixed reference point or datum. Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) calculates bearing and range (time difference) of a target providing a two-dimensional position.",

PRF is one of the main factors that determine the maximum theoretical unambiguous range of a pulse radar. The trasmitter must remain “silent” while the receiver is “listening” for echoes. If the design maximum range is 200NM the receiver must be allowed to “listen” for the period of time fro when a pulse has been trasmitted untill it can go to 200NM and than return. That is a round trip of 400 NM, which would require a longer “silent period” than a radar whit a range of 100NM where the pulses have to travel only 200NM. Therefore we can say that a lower PRF enables a longer maximum theoretical range: max therorical range is inversly proportional to the PRF. The following formula may be used to calculate the max theoretical unambiguous range : Range (in Km) = 300 000 ÷ ( PRF x 2 ), or if we need to find the required PRF based on a specific unambiguous range needed, we can rearrange the formula: PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( Range (in Km) x 2)",

            "explanation": "THUNDERSTORM AVOIDANCE It’s simple: Airplanes and thunderstorms don’t mix. Flying through a Thunderstorm, especially in a light aircraft, can be deadly. Thunderstorms can produce airframe-shattering turbulence, damaging hail, sudden and dramatic wind shear, strong, gusty winds—sometimes as much as 20 miles from the edge of a cell. Never regard any thunderstorm lightly. According to ICAO AC 120-88A Appendix 1: AVOID any convective activity (CBs) en route by at least 20 nautical miles. Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud. If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm. Generally speaking, you'll find the best chance for clear, smooth air on the upwind side of a thunderstorm. Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft. If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self stabilising at a chosen attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch/roll changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high in the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and high again during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display. On modern aircraft, there is often an auto tilt setting that is used to relieve pilot workload, but can be overriden for manual tasks. In this question, the best feature is the ability to scan other levels for more/less precipitation, potentially to choose a better level to penetrate precipitation at. It would not be useful to scan clear air above a developing thunderstorm as the CB cloud will continue rising, so this data becomes useless very quickly.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) : a surveillance radar system which uses reflected radio signals. Source: ICAO Doc 4444 PANS-ATM Principle of operation: The radar antenna rotates (usually at 5-12 rpm) emits a pulse of radio wave. Upon reaching an aircraft (or other object) the wave is reflected and some of the energy is returned to the antenna. The PSR output data uses polar coordinate system: it provides range and bearing of the targets found in respect of the antenna position. Note that the range is the slant distance from the antenna and not the horizontal distance. The range is determined by the time difference of the emitted and received pulse (the speed of propagation is the speed of light) and the bearing is obtained from the antenna azimuth. The rotation speed of the antenna is usually between 5 and 12 rpm. The antenna radiation patern is a narrow beam when seen from above and, whith some approximation, can be considered as a trapezium if seen from the side. The advantage of Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) is that it operates totally independently of the target aircraft (no action from the aircraft is required for it to provide a radar return). The disadvantages of PSR are that, firstly, enormous amounts of power must be radiated to ensure returns from the target. This is especially true if long range is desired. Secondly, because of the small amount of energy returned at the receiver, returns may be easily disrupted due to such factors as changes of target attitude or signal attenuation due to heavy rain. This may cause the displayed target to 'fade'. Thirdly, correlation of a particular radar return with a particular aircraft requires an identification process. When PSR was the only type of radar available, this was typically achieved by the Controller instructing an aircraft to turn and observing same on their display, or by correlating a DME distance report by the aircraft with the position of a particular return along a known track. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) requires an airborne transponder which responds to the receipt of a pulse from a ground-based antenna by transmitting a return signal. Because the transponder transmits a much stronger signal than that which is reflected off an aircraft in primary radar systems, greater range and reliability can be achieved with secondary radar and cheaper and more efficient ground equipment can be used. Additionally, information such as altitude and a code can be added to the returned signal from the transponder which is then displayed on the operator’s screen. The great advantages of SSR are three: firstly, because the reply signal is transmitted from the aircraft it is much stronger when received at the ground station, thus giving the possibility of much greater range and reducing the problems of signal attenuation; similarly, the transmitting power required of the ground station for a given range is much reduced, thus providing considerable economy; and thirdly, because the signals in each direction are electronically coded the possibility is offered to transmit additional information between the two stations. The disadvantage of SSR is that it requires a target aircraft to carry an operating transponder. Thus SSR is a 'dependant' surveillance system. For this reason, PSR will operate in conjunction with SSR in certain areas for the foreseeable future so that 'non-cooperating' targets, such as some light aircraft, can be detected. SSR has several modes of operation, the basic civil mode being Mode A. In this mode the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. The code system is octal; that is, each of the code digits may be any of the numbers 0-7. There are thus 4096 possible four-digit codes. Another principal SSR mode currently used is Mode C. In this mode the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. The use of Mode C was introduced in Australia in the late 1980s with the acquisition of ground systems, such as ATCARDS, capable of processing the information. A further mode, Mode S (or 'Mode Select'), is also used. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting this mode are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. This reduces problems of garbling between SSR returns from aircraft in close proximity. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) work by transmitting microwave pulses forwards from the aircraft, in a standard sweeping radar pattern, then waiting for any reflected pulses to return, measuring the time taken to return, and plotting the position of the reflector (raindrops, hail, suspended water in a cloud of all types - some better reflectors than others) on the screen. The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Here we can see that the very intense cell above aerodrome A is blocking the vast majority of returns in a corridor of shadow behind it. Therefore, Aerodrome B's precipitation is unknown. Aerodrome C, however, is not shadowed by a huge cell, and the low intensity green cell in front of it is not enough to block the majority of the pulses, so therefore the radar image at C is correct, little to no precipitation.",

Learning Objective 062.03.03.06.04: Explain how wind shear can be detected by a modern weather radar. This question has to be very specific in order for it not to have 2 correct answers. The fact that it says \"modern aircraft\" certainly means that they are referring to the learning objectives above. These refer to the turbulence and wind shear detection capabilities of modern airborne weather radars (AWRs), not the precipitation detection which has been around for over 70 years. Between windshear detection and turbulence detection, they are almost the same process, but windshear detection involves input from the Air Data Computer (ADC), via the GPWS system to produce windshear alerting (and it is not an available answer option). Therefore the correct answer can only be turbulence detection. We look ahead using our AWR to check our planned routing, and occasionally choose a better one. Turbulence can be detected by modern AWRs, as the movement of the precipitation within the cloud causes a doppler shift on the returning radar pulses, so the radar can form an idea of the air movement patterns in that area. If they are erratic, then turbulence exists in that region. This cannot detect CAT (clear air turbulence), as that has no associated radar returns, as it is invisible by definition.",

These AAs are unique addresses registered to a particular aircraft. There is also a much larger ability for transfer of information through mode S, with many different aircraft parameters able to be transferred to the ground through ELS (elementary surveillance) or EHS (enhanced surveillance) systems, and even a capacity of communications via datalink. Mode S transponders use the same frequencies as Mode A/C transponders, so are backwards compatible, and the SSR ground station produces different interrogation pulses to require different responses from the transponders in the area. For example, the interrogation station can send out Mode A/C only \"All Calls\", with a short fourth pulse (P4), which means nothing to the older Mode A/C transponders (they will reply normally), but means that the mode S transponders will reply with only their mode A/C information. This backwards compatibility means that theoretically, the interrogation signal could ask for mode A responses only, so the transponder (even though it is fully mode S capable) will just respond with its 4 digit squawk code.",

The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

MODE S Modes A and C are limited to 4 096 available codes. With an increasing volume of air traffic, these systems become prone to interference. Mode S was invented to overcome these limitations. \"S\" stands for Selective Addressing, which means that a specific aircraft my be interrogated by the controller. One of the main features of Mode S is the availability of codes. The aircraft address code will be made up of a 24-bit code. Considering a 24-bit binary code, it provides over 16 million (224 = 16 777 216) possible hard-coded unique addresses to be allocated. These are allocated to a particular aircraft, unlike a squawk code which is allocated for a particular flight plan. Mode S differs from Modes A and C due to the additional data message up to 112 bits that is transmitted via interrogation.",

Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) is the number of occurrences (pulses) each second. The PRF has a large significance on maximum range. Depending on how far the radar wishes to search for objects and what the visible range is, the Pulse Repetition interval has to be set in a way to always allow the pulse to reach the range limits and return, before the next pulse is sent. The maximum theoretical unambiguous range is calculate by the formula: Range [km] = 300 000 ÷ (PRF × 2) In the above formula, the range is given in kilometres and the PRF is in pps. The formula includes \"300 000\" which represents the number of km the light travels every second (speed of light). The minimum detection range of a pulse radar is determined primarily by the pulse length/width. Longer pulses are better for long range detection, as there is more energy available to be reflected, similar to using a higher power radar, but with very slightly less accuracy on the exact distance. The problem is that longer pulses do not allow short range radar reflections, as the pulse is still being emitted whilst the first reflections are returning. This is why we cannot have the best of both worlds, long maximum range and short minimum range, and compromises have to be made. Therefore, a lower PRF (longer gap between pulses) means longer maximum range. A lower Pulse Length allows for shorter minimum range.",

Why the question has been written in the first place is confusing, as the question is lacking information about the exact issue, and we should not need to understand cathode ray tubes as part of the syllabus. A cathode ray tube is an old style of visual display, commonly seen in old TVs (before flat screens), with large boxes behind the screen. It was very common to have CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays in older aircraft whenever a screen was required in the flight deck. They are heavy, draw quite a lot of power, and break easily. They operate by firing electrons through the tube and using electromagnets to bend the electrons either up or down to a point on the screen. When the electrons hit the photoluminescent coating at the end of the tube, it lights up, and by scanning a beam backwards and forwards along a horizontal line very quickly, this forms an image, which can even be made in colour. If there is just a bright line on the screen, it likely means that the electromagnetic coils in the CRT display are broken, or that the electron beam scanner does not work (depending on whether the line is vertical or horizontal), and all the electrons are ending up in a single line. The other options here to do with broken weather radar equipment would at least show the usual information on the screen (range of scan, tilt setting, etc.). Possibly, a vertical line could show up if the scanner was not rotating and many returns were being picked up from directly ahead, but the question seemed to say that the line was the only thing on the screen, which would not seem right if everything was working except the rotation. The feedback also indicated that a faulty cathode ray tube was the correct answer. Again, this should be appealed, it is ridiculous.",

However, the option \"By selecting a suitable echo from the display, obtaining the relative bearing and distance, and converting it into a true bearing to plot on the chart.\" has been confirmed by feedback to be correct in official exams. The pilot may take a relative bearing from an AWR display and would then use the aircraft heading to turn the relative heading into a magnetic or true bearing to. Thereafter, the reciprocal from the ground feature can be back-plotted as true or magnetic. On the other hand, putting the AWR into \"mapping\" mode allows the radar to reflect off surface features, which can give quite a good indication of the ground profile nearby. For instance, ground mapping radar can allow pilots to distinguish coastlines quite easily, as well as mountain ranges and sometimes even cities. To establish a fix, the pilots would place the AWR in mapping mode and/or tilt the radar down a lot, then look for echoes on the display that show these features, comparing that with a chart to get an idea of their position. It is certainly a skill, and not one that will be passed through the generations of pilots very well in the modern era, as it is almost useless these days. Note: There are a couple of other options that are close to being correct, whilst none of the others are completely true. Please send us any further exam feedback you have so we can verify this question and correct answer, thanks!",

CAL – rotate to the CAL position for automatic gain control. The CAL position results in a calibrated map or weather radar display. Gain control does not affect turbulence or windshear. Manual – rotating the knob out of CAL varies gain between MIN and MAX. VAR is shown on the display, indicating that the gain has been changed from the calibrated position. MIN – position reduces gain approximately 16 dBz below the CAL setting. Rotating the selector toward min reduces precipitation intensity thresholds, requiring greater intensity precipitation levels to display in red. MAX – position increases gain 10 dBz over the CAL setting. Rotating the selector toward MAX increases precipitation intensity thresholds allowing lesser intensity precipitation levels to display in red. Max gain should only be used at cruise altitudes to help see less reflective frozen storm tops. (Increasing the GAIN, increases the sensitivity of the receiver.)",

Mode S was invented to overcome these limitations. \"S\" stands for Selective Addressing, which means that a specific aircraft my be interrogated by the controller. One of the main features of Mode S is the availability of codes: The aircraft address code will be made up of a 24 bit code. Considering a 24-bit binary code, it provides over 16 million (224 = 16 777 216) possible hard-coded individual addresses to be allocated. Mode S differs from Modes A and C due to the additional data message up to 112 bits that is transmitted via interrogation.",

When these pulses encounter an aircraft or object, some of the energy is reflected back to the antenna. The PSR uses a polar coordinate system to provide information on the detected targets. It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth. RANGE The range is determined by comparing the time it takes for the pulse to be emitted and received, utilizing the speed of light as the propagation speed. It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING Bearing measurement in radar systems utilizes the searchlight principle, where radio pulses are focused into narrow beams. This can be achieved by reducing the wavelength or electronically enlarging the antenna in advanced systems. The narrow beam is then rotated at a consistent speed. By analyzing the direction of the received echo, the bearing of the object can be determined based on the azimuth of the antenna at the time of receiving the echo. This directional information is measured from a fixed reference point or datum Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) calculates bearing (antenna's azimuth) and range (time difference) of a target providing a two-dimensional position.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder. SSR positively identifies an aircraft’s primary response by displaying its code and call sign alongside.",

Gain control: this adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. Radar modes: weather (WX) or weather + turbulence (WX + T). Early generation of full manual controlled radars were without auto tilt. Honeywell introduced the first weather radar featuring with an automatic tilt computation named “Autotilt”. When in Autotilt mode, the radar uses the EGPWS terrain database and automatically adjusts the antenna tilt based on the aircraft position, altitude, and the selected ND range (fig.6). The next generation of radars (fully automatic radars) optimize weather detection and decrease significantly the pilots’ workload necessary to understand the complete picture of the weather ahead. They included automatic functions, which: Scan airspace ahead of the aircraft with multiple beams Feature a three dimensional (3D) buffer to store weather data Automatically compute and adjust the antenna tilt Offer independent pilot control and display selection. This kind of radars automatically adjusts the gain and tilt based on various parameters (aircraft altitude, geographical area, season, time of the day) to obtain the best weather display in each geographic region.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self-stabilising at a particular attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, then reduced during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (such as developing thunderstorms) that could affect the aircraft. It should be kept low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display.",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like reflection from afar, and they may refer to it as such. Ground waves and sky waves both exist below the frequencies of VHF (30 MHz). Some strong ionospheric attenuation effects can affect the lower end of the VHF band, but in general, VHF, UHF and upwards all rely on space waves to communicate, and hence are reliant on line-of-sight.",

It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication. Thus the range of communication can be increased by increasing the heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The space wave propagation is utilized in television communication, radar communication etc.",

The CPDLC is a FANS application that consists of transmitting datalink formatted messages between the pilot (the aircraft) and the ATC controller or the Company (the ground). A message sent by the aircraft to the ground is called a downlink message, the opposite is called an uplink message. Datalink messages may concern various requests such as route modifications, speed changes, voice contact requests (ex: transfer of ATC center), emergency messages (MAYDAY), crossing constraints, pre-departure clearances, ATIS, oceanic clearances, etc. Datalink messages can be sent using different media such as HF datalink, VHF datalink, or SATCOM. The SATCOM has the fastest rate of transmission, while the HF datalink has the slowest. The SATCOM is particularly good as there is no line-of-sight limitation and no variable quality of signals disturbed by ionospheric conditions, however, this media is not installed on all airplanes. The ground routing of the ATC datalink communications is performed by service providers (SITA, ARINC) that can be interconnected to provide continuity of the transmissions. The ACARS allows air/ground datalink communications for Airline Operational and Air Traffic Communications (AOC and ATC). It stands for Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System and is included in the aircraft Management Unit (or MU or CMU). ACARS messages are transmitted from the ground to the aircraft and vice-versa using several radio communication media such as VHF, HF, SATCOM. In the early days of the ACARS, it was using only VHF for transmission, but nowadays advanced technology allows the ACARS to chose itself the transmitting method depending on the current coverage and flown airspace.",

Refraction is when waves, whether physical or electromagnetic, are deflected going through a substance. The wave generally changes the angle of its general direction. Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit these characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Interference is the phenomenon where waves meet each other and combine additively or substractively to form composite waves. In a sense there are similarities between interference and diffraction in the fact that both phenomena from a given wave produce other waves (with in general different frequency or phase and/or amplitude etc.). The main difference is the mechanism, diffraction involves a wave and some obstacle or object which deflects the wave or bends it and intereference involves a wave which combine with other waves.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed at the end, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) so FM (Frequency Modulation) is usually more clear, but has its own disadvantages.",

Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it can only be figure 1 or 6 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for an ILS mode, where the frequency of the ILS is indicated at the bottom of the display. Figure 1 indicates ‘VOR’ and figure 6 indicates ‘ILS’ with its associated frequency on the right of the ND. Therefore, the correct ND is represented in figure 6.",

            "explanation": "Radio waves propagate as surface waves, sky waves or space waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. Surface wave propagation can be achieved in VLF, LF, MF and HF radio waves. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Sky wave propagation is possible in HF frequency band. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. Space wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves in a straight line. Space wave propagation requires line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Space wave propagation is achieved at VHF frequencies and above. The maximum theoretical range (in nm) of a space wave is 1.23 x √H1 + 1.23 x √H2 where H1 is the height in feet of the transmitter above mean sea level and H2 is the height in feet of the receiver above mean sea level. Surface waves ⇒ VLF, LF, MF and HF Sky waves ⇒ HF Space waves ⇒ VHF and above",

If the turn is unbalanced, an aircraft either slips into, or skids out of the turn, thereby reducing the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds",

These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Many RADARs are so-called \"Pulse RADARs\", as they operate by transmitting a very short pulse of a particular frequency, then they wait for a much longer time to receive a potential reflection off an object in that direction. Any such reflections are called returns, and the time between the pulse and the return can be used to calculate the distance to the object, as these pulses travel at the speed of light. This means that the pulse returns carry time data, which is information that the RADAR can use. These RADARs usually scan from side to side, and do this process hundreds or thousands of times per second, which allows obect locations to be plotted on a display. This is a modern usage of pulse modulation.",

            "explanation": "The Doppler effect is where waves (electromagnetic in all these cases) have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart (see the above annex, it occurs for EM waves and sound waves). It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. VORs use this principle in Doppler VORs (DVORs) which are the modern versions of VOR beacons. The variphase signal of the VOR is transmitted by a ring of antennas in a circle, and the signal transfers to each consecutive antenna, so the transmission point of the signal effectively moves round in a circle. This allows an aircraft to receive a frequency modulated signal due to the Doppler effect, to compare phase difference with the amplitude modulated reference signal, and calculate the aircraft's radial. GNSS (including GPS) systems use the Doppler effect to measure an object's speed, as the pseudo-random noise (PRN) signals are on an exact frequency, and the receiver knows the velocities of each satellite, so is able to work out the relative movement of the receiver with very small Doppler changes in frequency. MTI (Moving Target Indication) is less common to hear about, but this system allows a RADAR to know which objects are moving towards or away from the station due to the Doppler effect of their reflected pulses. It can be used to only show moving targets and remove radar clutter. Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) use the Doppler effect to judge the relative movements of moisture particles (raindrops, hail, etc.) based on the frequency of the reflected returns. If this movement is large and erratic, the RADAR system can then show it as an area of turbulence, which is useful information for the pilot. DMEs use a system of time measurement to measure distance from a ground station, and the \"groundspeed\" function uses the rate of change of that distance, not the Doppler effect. ILSs use difference in depth of modulation as a method of working out how far off localiser/glideslope the aircraft is, not the Doppler effect. AWRs have a mapping mode, but this does not use any Doppler measurements, as the ground is supposed to stay still.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 375 kHz, which is 375 x103 Hz or 0.375 MHz. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 375x103 = 800 m",

Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption. Note: The reduction in side lobes is the main improvement referred to in the question, but there is also an option which mentions the reduced beam width. Whilst the beam width is thinner for a modern flat plate antenna, the use of the word \"considerably\" does make that option more specific, and less likely to be correct. This is backed up with feedback showing that the \"reduced side lobe\" answer is considered correct by EASA.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 118.7 MHz, which is 118.7 x106 Hz or 118 700 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 118.7x106 = 2.53 m",

            "explanation": "HF propagation over long distances during day and night is by skywave propagation originated by the reflection and refraction of radio waves between Earth's surface and the ionosphere. HF Radio waves can be reflected by the ionosphere and the earth's surface and propagate long distance from the transmitter to the receiver with several hops. Path loss of sky wave propagation varies with different conditions of ionosphere and types of the earth's surfaces. The ionosphere is a consequence of radiation from the sun ionizing Earth's atmosphere, so it changes significantly with time of day and sunspot activity. The F layer is mostly responsible for the refraction of radio waves back to Earth, preventing them from escaping to space. The other layers interact in other ways. During the day, the D layer forms, and the F layer splits into F1 and F2 layers. The D layer is present during the day and is a good absorber of radio waves, increasing losses ( for MF and LF power loss is so high that sky-wave propagation is not possible for them). Hf frequency can propagate like ground wave as well but their range is very small: as the wavefront of the ground wave travels along the Earth's surface it is attenuated. The degree of attenuation is dependent upon a variety of factors. Frequency of the radio signal is one of the major determining factor as losses rise with increasing frequency. As a result, it makes this form of propagation impracticable above the bottom end of the HF portion of the spectrum (3 MHz). Typically a signal at 3.0 MHz will suffer an attenuation that may be in the region of 20 to 60 dB more than one at 0.5 MHz dependent upon a variety of factors in the signal path including the distance. In view of this it can be seen why even high power HF radio broadcast stations may only be audible for a few miles from the transmitting site via the ground wave",

            "explanation": "Amplitude modulation is a process by which the wave signal is transmitted by modulating the amplitude of the signal. It is often called as AM and is commonly used in transmitting a piece of information through a radio carrier wave. Amplitude modulation is mostly used in the form of electronic communication. Currently, this technique is used in many areas of communication such as in portable two-way radios, citizens band radio, VHF aircraft radio and in modems for computers. Amplitude modulation is also used to mention the mediumwave AM radio broadcasting. In general, amplitude modulation definition is given as a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in some proportion with respect to the modulating data or the signal. As for the mechanism, when amplitude modulation is used there is a variation in the amplitude of the carrier. Here, the voltage or the power level of the information signal changes the amplitude of the carrier. In AM, the carrier does not vary in amplitude. However, the modulating data is in the form of signal components consisting of frequencies either higher or lower than that of the carrier. The signal components are known as sidebands and the sideband power is responsible for the variations in the overall amplitude of the signal. (refer to annex1) The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. (refer to annex 2) Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both ground waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth - also called surface waves) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere). This can actually cause some interference when the two meet, especially at night when the ionosphere is thinner.",

Mixing of low frequency signal with high frequency carrier signal is called modulation. The sinusoidal signal that is used in the modulation is known as the carrier signal, or simply \"the carrier\". The signal that is used in modulating the carrier signal (or sinusoidal signal) is known as the \"data signal\" or the \"message signal\". A carrier wave is a pure wave of constant frequency, a bit like a sine wave. By itself it doesn’t carry much information that we can relate to (such as speech or data). To include speech information or data information, another wave needs to be imposed, called an input signal, on top of the carrier wave. This process of imposing an input signal onto a carrier wave is called modulation. In other words, modulation changes the shape of a carrier wave to somehow encode the speech or data information that we were interested in carrying. Modulation is like hiding a code inside the carrier wave. Recall that any wave has three basic properties: Amplitude – the height of the wave Frequency – a number of waves passing through in a given second Phase – where the phase is at any given moment.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.03.01: Define ‘space waves’: the electromagnetic waves travelling through the air directly from the transmitter to the receiver. As the aircraft in this scenario is communicating with the ground station via VHF radio, the radio signals will only propagate as space waves. Space waves are line-of-sight waves that go in straight lines only, and therefore cannot go around obstacles, including around the Earth's horizon. This means that there is a very well defined limit of how far VHF communications can be received from. It is calculated with the formula: Range (nm) = 1.23 x √(height of transmitter(ft)) + 1.23 x √(height of receiver(ft)) As soon as the aircraft is outside of this range, VHF communication will not be possible. Relays with other aircraft closer to land could be used, but the aircraft will usually change to HF radio and datalink communications instead. HF radio can travel as a sky wave, which requires ionospheric refraction to \"bounce\" the signal off the upper atmosphere, and as a short surface/ground wave (although this is not really used), so can allow transmissions that can go further than the line-of-sight limitations of VHF. VHF has a frequency too high to be affected much by ionospheric attenuation and refraction, and therefore will not be able to form a sky wave. Its frequency is also too high to propagate for any reasonable distances as a ground wave, as the attenuation due to obstacles, etc. is huge. Even HF radio struggles to propagate as ground waves for our uses, so VHF is ever worse. There is some diffraction of VHF radio waves around the Earth's surface, which extends range slightly, but it is not a huge effect. Note: The mention of dawn in the question is not necessary, VHF radio is not affected by ionospheric refraction which could create a sky wave, so dawn/dusk/night does not make a difference.",

Tropospheric refraction occurs because the refractive index of the atmosphere decreases as altitude increases, leading to a bending of waves back toward the earth. Conversely, ionospheric refraction occurs because of the electrical properties of plasmas that are formed in the ionosphere as a result of ionization of the atmosphere. Reflection off the ionosphere is also possible if the frequency is low enough. We will differentiate these two effects, and refer to the former as atmospheric refraction and the latter as ionospheric propagation. The atmosphere will also attenuate radio signals, due to absorption by air molecules, water molecules, and precipitation (rain) The most important thing to note is that refractivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to pressure and humidity. Hence, as we go higher into the atmosphere, the refractivity tends to drop somce the pressure is less, and the air is more dry. Temperature plays a role as well, and in reality temperature gradients can cause the refractivity profile to be non-monotonic.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed in the receiver, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) and it also produces two \"side bands\" of information, one wave at the top, on at the bottom, of which one can be removed to save on power and bandwidth, as is done with HF communications in aviation.",

Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption.",

            "explanation": "HF radio waves propagate as both surface waves and sky waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. IONISATION AND SKIP DISTANCE At a fixed frequency, if ionisation decreases, the critical angle increases. This causes an increase in skip distance. Ionosphere exists due to Sun radiation. During dusk and night, Sun radiation is less and ionisation decreases, causing skip distance to become larger. This means that, for a constant frequency, the first sky wave reflects further away during the night than during the day. The aircraft is following an East Track (090°) and the Sun has set. This means that dusk is experienced and the decrease in ionisation causes the sky waves to propagate with a larger skip distance. If the aircraft was receiving surface waves, the sunset would not affect their perception. Consequently, the aircraft was receiving sky waves and the ionospheric changes have affected their path. The aircraft has entered the skip zone between the skywave and the surface wave (dead space).",

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial. The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readingsi. This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.01.01.02.05: Define ‘phase angle’: the fraction of one wavelength expressed in degrees from 000 degrees to 360 degrees. As mentioned in the above learning objective, \"phase\" is a way to measure the position within a wave cycle. For instance, the first quarter of a wave cycle (from equilibrium up to the first peak, for example) is a phase of 1/4, but as we measure phases in terms of angles, it is 90º (1/4 of 360º). This means that a whole wave cycle makes up 360º of phase, which would represent a full circle, which is correct as circles are closely linked to waves. Phase can either dictate a position within a wave, or a \"distance\" within a wave, for instance a peak and a trough are 180º different in phase. It can also, in the same way, compare the timings of two waves (of the same frequency), called phase difference. Phase difference can tell us that two similar waves are at different points during their wave cycles, so if two waves were 180º out of phase, one would be at a peak and the other would be at a trough at the same time. In this question though, we are talking about \"phase\" only, not phase difference, so it is the first of these, the position within a wave cycle, expressed as an angle from 0-360º",

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it cannot be figure 1 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a MAP mode, where NO ILS or VOR frequency is indicated at the bottom. Figure 4 indicates ‘VOR’, and on figure 2 you can see the plan mode with a large part of the route displayed and the True North indication at the bottom. Figure 3, however, has no VOR/ILS indication and at the deviation scale corresponds only to the deviation from the current FMS flight plan route. Figure 3 ND is displayed in MAP mode.",
