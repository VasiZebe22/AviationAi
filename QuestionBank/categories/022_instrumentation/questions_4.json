On the other hand, the Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a stand-alone platform aligned with the local vertical (=gravity) where the accelerations are measured in an axis co-ordinate system which is free from the aircraft’s body axis coordinate system.",

Accelerations in the East/West and North/South directions are measured by the accelerometers and are integrated. Acceleration integrated over time: Once = change in velocity. Twice = change in position. It is also true if we state that integrating velocity once over time gives the change in position. Internally, this is calculated by integrators that are time multiplication devices. Initially, acceleration is supplied to the integrator as a value in ft/sec². Multiplying a value in ft/sec² by another value in sec will give you a result in ft/sec => velocity. Velocity is basically how fast has the aircraft moved in feet per second. Then, this value is sent to another integrator to derive the change in position and determine the current position of the aircraft. In other words, a value in ft/sec is multiplied again by a value in seconds, which will result in a value in feet or NM => distance. The second integration will provide the IRS with the distance traveled, but if the initial position AND speed are known as well, the IRS will output the instantaneous position. Summary table of the integration process of the INS and the required inputs: Integrate with time. How many times? Additional Input(s) Output ACCELERATION Once Initial SPEED Instantaneous SPEED ACCELERATION Once ----- Change in SPEED (velocity) ACCELERATION TWICE Initial POSITION + Initial SPEED Instantaneous POSITION ACCELERATION TWICE ----- POSITION SPEED ONCE ----- DISTANCE traveled",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

When stationary the only output from the accelerometers will be due to gravity. During alignment the platform is driven by torque motors until no acceleration is sensed and is therefore level. Once level the platform has to be 'gyrocompassed' to align it with True North. This is acheived by monitoring the output of the gyros to sense topple caused by Earth rotation, the time taken to do this increases with latitude. For these reasons alignment can only be acheived if the aircraft is stationary. Moving an aircraft during alignment will require the process to start again when stationary and it could take as long as 15 - 20 minutes before alignment is complete. Pilots should always wait until INS alignment is complete before moving the aircraft",

The question is asking how these unbounded errors are affecting the system over time since they are the only cumulative errors. In fact, they increase proportionally with time, which means that the error increases as ‘t’ increases. Bounded errors are usually the following: Initial misalignment may not be conducted 100% correctly (aircraft shaking due to ground equipment positioning, crew activity, etc.) There can always be some errors due to the initial misalignment. Accelerators are mechanical systems consisting of a pendulous mechanism, pickoffs and servos that suffer all from the standard instrument error (manufacturing imperfections). Integrators make errors in the first stage of integration due to the incorrect inputs provided (listed in the points above). Unbounded errors are usually the following: Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. Drift of the gyroscopes of the platform, which are the main source of error.",

The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. This system is composed of a stable platform consisting of high quality gyros and accelerometers and a computer. The purpose of the computer is to integrate the accelerometer outputs with time to give velocity and then integrate velocity with time to give distance travelled. From this is available pitch and roll attitude, true heading, true track, drift, present position in latitude and longitude, ground speed and wind. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. These acceleration measuring devices sense any change in the aircraft’s velocity either as an acceleration or deceleration very accurately. The acceleration signal from the amplifier is sent to an integrator which is a time multiplication device. It starts out with acceleration which is in feet per second squared. In the integrator, it is multiplied by time and the result is a velocity in feet per second. With an input of feet per second, it is then sent through a second integrator, which is multiplied by time, the result is a distance in feet or nautical miles. The computer associated with the inertial system knows the latitude and longitude of the take-off point and calculates that the aircraft has travelled so far in the north and east direction. The computer can then compute the new position of the aircraft and give a digital read-out.",

            "explanation": "An Inertial Navigation System (INS) provides the aeroplane’s velocity and position by continuously measuring and integrating its acceleration. This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes. Input data is also required, such as the: TAS - to calculate the wind speed/direction. Initial position – because actual aircraft position during the flight is calculated based on the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – the platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. GNSS (GPS) Position - in order to bound the INS position error. Other inptus are: Mach Number, Radio height, Number of satellites and Angle of attack. Note: The correct option was selected according to EASA LO 022.05.01.01.02 which states 'State that inertial systems require no external input, except TAS, to determine aircraft attitude and navigational data.'

They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation. -It consists of three RLGs that measure angular rates and three internal accelerometers measuring acceleration on all three aircraft’s body axes (longitudinal, lateral, and normal). The laser gyros allow a microprocessor to maintain a stable platform mathematically, rather than mechanically. - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data.

Instead, the system uses ring laser gyros (RLGs) that are attached to the aircraft structure in a specific orientation, and are therefore referred to as strapped-down. The coordinate system for computations is composed of the 3 aircraft axes. The IRS uses 3 accelerometers and 3 RLGs that are installed at right angles to one another to measure linear accelerations and rotations around the aircraft axes. A high-performance computer creates a virtual stabilised platform that is kept aligned by using information from the gyros. Note that there is no physical platform that is kept aligned/level. In flight, the aircraft moves around the centre of gravity (CG). Placing the IRS unit close to the CG improves the reliability of the readings and reduces the amount of IRS drift experienced. RLGs produce two, constant, high-frequency beams of light that travel over a system of mirrors/through fibreoptics, in opposite directions. When the RLG is at rest, the signal from both beams is identical. When a RLG is rotated about its sensitive axis, both beams are affected by the Doppler effect. One is red shifted, and the other blue shifted. This causes a phase difference which can be interpreted by the computer to map motion. \"The IRS is located a bit away from the aircraft CG and it uses laser gyros to calculate accelerations.\" INCORRECT. The laser gyros do not detect accelerations - accelerometers do that job. Furthermore, as stated above, it is located close to the CG of the aircraft. \"It consists of gyros and accelerometers. The gyros keep the platform level and the accelerometers calculate acceleration.\" INCORRECT. The older stable-platform INS uses gyros and accelerometers on a level platform. \"The IRS is most reliable using lower frequency laser beams.\" INCORRECT. Laser gyros use a high frequency excitation of the laser gas, not low frequency.",

For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. LEVELLING AND ALIGNMENT For a conventional gyro system, the process of levelling and alignment takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It is important that the aeroplane does not move during this process, because the resultant accelerations upset the system, preventing the platform from aligning. This process also requires corrections to be applied, which are dependent on the system being ‘told’ the accurate value of the present latitude and longitude. The alignment process is unsuccessful if the wrong latitude is initially entered into the system; if the error is small, it leads to poor alignment and degraded accuracy. If the latitude error is large, the platform is unable to align. If the longitude is however wrongly inserted during the initialisation process, it does not adversely affect the alignment process, but will affect the accuracy of any subsequent position. This is because the INS is a direct reading system, and if you start with a wrong position all subsequent positions are wrong.",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

The main difference between the two systems is that an IRS uses solid-state sensors, such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes, instead of traditional mechanical gyroscopes and accelerometers. Some of the main advantages of the more modern IRS are: - The solid-state sensors are more reliable and require less maintenance compared to mechanical gyroscopes. They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data. For example, errors caused by temperature changes, sensor drift, or other external factors. While traditional INS systems using mechanical gyroscopes and stand-alone computers are still in use in many aircraft today, IRS systems offer several advantages over their predecessors, including higher accuracy, faster response times, and better reliability.",

The general principle of an inertia navigation system (INS) is that the system measures the aircraft's accelerations from a known position and speed, then integrates those accelerations to calculate speed and therefore distance travelled in each axis (North/South and East/West) to constantly determine its up-to-date position. The components of an INS are 1. Accelerometers 2. Gyroscopes 3. Position computer A \"stable platform INS\" is made in such a way that the 3 rate-integrating gyroscopes measure any rotations of the aircraft and immediately apply a current to a motor to oppose this motion, thereby keeping the platform in the same orientation it was set to (horizontal and North facing). This means that the 2 accelerometers are kept in the same orientation relative to the Earth's surface, and therefore can measure just the accelerations in the North/South and East/West axes.",

There is a requirement to initialise inertial systems before flight, and the aircraft must be still, with the known exact location inputted into the system by the pilots (or automatically these days). The INS/IRS also takes some time to get its own systems aligned, and judge the Earth's rotation, find True North, etc. Depending on the system (old INS's take much longer and are less accurate), this takes 5-10 minutes in mid latitudes, and up to 17 minutes at high latitudes (>70°). The learning objectives (022-Instruments) say 10-20 minutes, but this is for the oldest INSs. In this case, we can use the standard figure of 10 minutes, where the aircraft is still, and the INS/IRSs can become aligned. It is usually under 10 minutes, but given that it mentions older INSs aswell, we can happily say 10 minutes.",

It is used for the aircraft inertial navigation systems and attitude/heading reference systems. It is a very accurate system to measure rotation about a given axis and is widespread in modern commercial aircraft IRS systems. Conventional gyro’s rotation mass is replaced by two contra-rotating beams of light. The case of the RLG is made of a vitreous ceramic material of low-temperature coefficient. Two gas-tight openings are carefully designed into the single-piece case of the RLG, which are then filled with inert gas, such as a mixture of Helium and Neon. A direct current electrical discharge ionizes the gas and creates two beams of light flowing in opposite directions in the two cavities of the RLG case. In order to produce a continuous laser circuit in the enclosed area of the RLG’s case, a set of mirrors is installed to reflect and trap the laser beams. The frequency of oscillation of each beam depends on the optical path length and corresponds to the cavity resonance condition. When the RLG is stationary, both optical path lengths of each beam are identical. However, when the RLG is rotated about the axis perpendicular to the laser beams plane, one beam will travel a larger distance, and the other will cover a shorter distance. The frequency difference induced by different path lengths is proportional to the rotation rate.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Most aircraft of any size will be fitted with at least two inertial systems. The duplication is for redundancy and so that the information can be compared for possible error. The starting point for an inertial navigation system is acceleration. If acceleration is known, then the aircraft's speed can be calculated. If the speed is known, the distance travelled can be calculated. To solve a complete navigation problem in space, we need to know the acceleration in three axes at right angles to each other. The inertial system relates its acceleration to the three axes and recognizes the direction, using three methods: Stable Platform or Stabilised Inertial Platform Wander Angle Strapdown The Stable Platform, which keeps the platform, on which the accelerometers are mounted, always level and aligned to North, and also measures acceleration relative to the platform. Alignment and levelling is done only once for each flight with the aircraft stationary on the ground. Once aligned, the inertial system is not and cannot be re-aligned for the remainder of the flight. Attitude data is still valid, and will continue to drive servo attitude and heading instruments or EFIS indications.",

The ADC collects relevant air data, automatically eliminates the position errors of its individual sensors, computes the required output parameters and provides them to as many systems as desired. Some air data can be displayed without further computations. These are the TAT, altitude and IAS. Because systems errors are internally corrected, IAS is equal to CAS. The centralised processing of air data parameters allows for the computation of additional outputs, which could not be obtained from separate instruments. TAT can be converted to the actual outside air temperature (OAT) considering the flight Mach number. Once OAT has been determined, it can be used to obtain TAS from the corrected values for static and total pressure (which is CAS).

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. The quality of information is dependent on the accuracy of the initial (input) data, and the precision with which the system aligns to True North. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. To keep the reference valid, the accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Rate integrating gyros are for use as sensors to detect any departure of the platform from its level and desired alignment. BOUNDED ERRORS These errors build up to a maximum positive and negative values, and return to zero within each 84.4 minutes Schuler cycle and thus averages out over the period. The main causes of these errors are: - platform tilt, due to initial misalignment - inaccurate measurement of acceleration by accelerometers - integrator errors in the first integration stage UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE TRACK ERRORS These errors arise from the misalignment of the accelerometers in the horizontal plane, and the main causes of these errors are: - Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. - Wander of the azimuth gyro. UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE DISTANCE ERROR These errors give rise to cumulative errors in the recording of the total distance travelled. The main causes of this error are: - Wander in the levelling gyros. - Integrator errors in the second stage of integration. INHERENT ERRORS The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. Such errors vary from system to system, depending upon the balance achieved between accuracy on one hand and the simplicity of design, reliability, ease of construction and cost of production on the other.",

The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. By entering the initial position and recording the IRU operation hours, the flight crew can compare the calculated position at the end of the flight with the actual position to determine the drift. RADIAL ERROR This error provides an indication of the continuing serviceability of the INS, and is derived from the following: Radial Error = Distance of final ramp position from INS position / Elapsed time in hours, expressed in (NM/hour) When calculating the distance between two positions, consider the latitude. It is also good practice to monitor the performance of the INS at the end of each flight. Comparing the INS display with the ramp position does this, where the radial error is established using Pythagoras, which when divided by the recorded time in the navigation mode, gives the average error.",

Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an Inertial Reference System (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Initial position – because actual aircraft position at any point during the flight, is calculated from the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – to stabilize the vertical navigation, thus stabilizing vertical velocity and inertial altitude information. The platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. The initial alignment and leveling of the IRS need to be carried out when the aircraft is stationary and on the ground. A set of three accelerometers will sense gravitational acceleration that will derive the local vertical of the platform. Once the vertical is found thanks to the gravity, any change of attitude in space will be detected, but they will only come from the Earth’s rotation (on the ground when stationary). Moreover, by detecting the drift due to the earth’s rotation, the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) will be able to internally calculate the True North. Latitude can also be internally calculated, but because this calculation is not sufficiently precise, a manual position input is required from the flight crew for this alignment sequence. Therefore, the system will compare the inserted latitude with the calculated one and compute precisely the aircraft’s position. On the other hand, the IRS cannot calculate/measure longitude, therefore the only reference is the one provided by the pilot during the alignment process.",

To assess the performance of individual IRUs after a flight, the pilot may: Review the residual indicated ground speed when the aircraft has parked; Review the drift given as NM/h. This can be done by comparing a known position, such as the coordinates of the aircraft parking stand with the calculated positions of the inertial systems.",

            "explanation": "Note: Obviously the wording is not very specific in this question, and we could use any further feedback for clarification on what EASA are asking. If you do have any further exam feedback, please let us know in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Inertial Navigation Systems are devices which allow us to have a self contained method of navigating, via just the accelerations of the aircraft. The basic principle is that, if an INS knows the initial location of the aircraft, and knows that it is completely still at that time (during initialisation), then it can precisely measure the aircraft's turns and accelerations to calculate its current position. It uses the mathematical process of integration to first work out the aircraft's velocity and direction, then integrates again to find the change in distance, which it then adds/removes from the original location. The oldest INSs use a \"stable platform\" design, which is a large platform that is kept pointing towards True North and perfectly upright, no matter the aircraft's heading or attitude. It manages this by using 3 rate-integrating gyros to measure the aircraft's turns around all three axes, and counter them by moving the platform the other way. It can then use 2 accelerometers to calculate the North-South acceleration, and the East-West accelerations, which are fed into a mechanical computer (a complex set of cogs and gears) that provide an output of speed and position, and other useful metrics. More modern aircraft use Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs), which are a form of INS, but are connected directly to the aircraft (no stable platform). These are much lighter, and less complex to have on board, as they use a set of 3 ring laser gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers to measure all the rotations and accelerations, and then calculates into their various components (North-South, East-West and Vertical) using modern computer methods. This is called a strapdown system, as it is fixed to the aircraft, and is much more usable with other systems, as it can feed info to the FMS, etc. This question is not very well worded, as the question is asking about inertial navigation systems, but the most correct answer (and the answer from feedback) is actually more related to IRSs. To clarify, we can go through each option: \"true airspeed (TAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" This is quite blatantly wrong, airspeed is measured in one axis by the pitot tubes. \"indicated Airspeed (IAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" Same as above, still wrong. \"acceleration along the aircraft's pitch, roll and yaw axes.\" This one is nearly correct, as it does sense accelerations, but not necessarily along these axes (and these axes refer to rotations). INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions (and maybe vertically). \"acceleration along the north-south, east-west and vertical axes.\" This is most correct, but only just. As mentioned above, INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions. They can sense vertical accelerations also, if they have a third accelerometer, but this is not so well documented in the learning objectives, and is more to do with IRSs, which all measure vertical acceleration as part of their normal process. This is why this question can garner some opposing views, depending on interpretation. So far, this is our best option.",

This means ensuring the autopilot does not break aircraft limitations in terms of speed, load factor, pitch and bank limits etc. The autopilot should be able to use a satisfactory amount of the performance of the aircraft otherwise the manoeuvres would take too long to execute. Whenever the autopilot is required to make a correction either for stability or when referring to a particular flight path, the control response will always be in proportion to deviation or corrective action required but only up to a limit that prevents the autopilot attempting a manoeuvre that would cause an excursion from the safe flight envelope. Command Speed Limiting The AFS provides speed, pitch and thrust commands to avoid exceeding the following limit speeds: - VMO/MMO. - Wing flap limiting speeds. - Landing gear speeds. - Minimum speed. Reversion Modes During some flight situations, speed control by the AFDS or A/T alone could be insufficient to prevent exceeding a limit speed. If this occurs, AFDS and A/T mode automatically revert to a more effective combination. The reversion modes are: - Placard Limit reversion. - Minimum airspeed reversion. Mode reversion occurs slightly before reaching the limit speed. Flight Envelope Protection Flight envelope protection is installed with the aim of ensuring that the aircraft remains within the normal flight envelope in all phases of flight The system provides protection in all phases of flight to prevent the aircraft exceeding the limits for the following parameters: - Angle of Attack - Speed - Pitch attitude - Bank angle - Loadfactor",

In other words, it off-loads any steady-state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes.

            "explanation": "The automatic pitch trim is used to: ensure the airplane is properly trimmed when the autopilot is disengaged. permits the elevator to always be in neutral position with respect to the horizontal stabilizer. In other words, it off-loads any steady-state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes. Summary: `HAND-OVER` - automatic pitch trim function. `TAKE-OVER` - automatic synchronization function.",

Therefore, if the indicator indicates a right deviation, it means that the desired track is right of the aircraft. In this case, if the flight director shows a left deflection it means that the aircraft needs a slight correction to the left in order to intercept the desired track in the most efficient way.

Autopilot Heading Mode The simplest nav mode is to have the aircraft keep flying in the direction you select, this is called Heading Mode. In this mode the pilot selects a desired heading, either using a knob on the HSI, using the central FDS/autopilot panel or on the MCP. The Flight Director roll bar commands the aeroplane to fly to the Pre- Selected Heading, and subsequently to hold that heading. To achieve this, the computer receives inputs from the attitude reference source, the VG, and the course from the compass system. If the heading source is purely magnetic, the Autopilot will follow the heading regarding this source. If is is incorrect, the autopilot will follow an incorrect heading. Having two flux-valves with combined outputs, is used to reduce errors which otherwise may be present in systems using single pendulously mounted magnetic field responsive devices.",

This speed is calculated and set during the pre-flight checks. The roll command maintains HDG SEL - the roll mode keeps the aircraft aligned with the runway heading.

The Go-around mode is one of the three mixed modes mentioned in the EASA LOs above, with the other two being take-off and approach modes. All three of these modes interact with the autothrottle and autopilot systems to achieve the desired outcomes. When the A/T ARM switch is turned on, the A/T go-around mode becomes active below 2000 feet RA, whether or not the AFDS is engaged. Once activated, the A/T go-around mode remains available for engagement until 2 seconds after touchdown. To engage this mode, you simply press the TOGA switch. When engaged, \"GA\" is displayed for the A/T, and the thrust levers move to the reduced go-around thrust setting, resulting in a climb rate of 1000 to 2000 feet per minute. Pressing the TOGA switch a second time causes the A/T to advance the thrust to the full go-around N1 limit. On Boeing aircraft, this entails pressing TOGA, while on Airbus planes, it involves moving the throttles into the TOGA detent. In either case, the engines power up to full thrust, and the autopilot disengages the approach mode, allowing the aircraft to climb away from the ground. It's important to note that the Go-around mode is not constrained by specific altitudes or heights. Therefore, if the pilot initiates a go-around, the aircraft will climb regardless of whether it is below or above the pre-selected missed approach altitude.",

The Vertical Speed in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). FLIGHT PATH ANGLE The Flight Path Angle is the angle between the Aircraft’s Velocity Vector and the Horizon. If you are flying in a level flight your Flight Path Angle will be zero (over the horizon), regardless of the Pitch Angle. During a descent, the Flight Path Angle will be negative (below the horizon) thus when climbing the Flight Path Angle will be positive (over the horizon). FLIGHT PATH VECTOR The circular symbol represents the aircraft's axis in relation to the vertical and lateral movement referenced to the Earth's surface. If you were stationary on the ground, the circle would be on the horizon line and centred in the display.

While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

The AP and FD pitch modes can control a target SPD/MACH or a vertical trajectory, and the A/THR mode can control a fixed thrust or a target SPD/MACH. However, the AP/FD and the A/THR cannot both control a target SPD/MACH simultaneously. Therefore the AP/FD pitch modes and A/THR mode are coordinated as follows: ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a vertical trajectory, the A/THR mode controls the target SPD/MACH. ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a target SPD or MACH, the A/THR mode controls the thrust. ‐ If no AP/FD pitch mode is engaged, the A/THR mode reverts to controlling the SPD/MACH mode. In other words, the selection of an AP/FD pitch mode determines which mode the A/THR controls. The FMGS has guidance parameters for both AP/FD lateral and vertical modes. The AP/FD lateral modes are the same. Two types of autopilot and flight director modes are available to guide the aircraft: ‐ One that steers the aircraft along the lateral, vertical, and speed profiles according to the data the pilot inserts into the MCDU. Flight Management (in the Flight Management and Guidance Computer) computes the corresponding guidance targets. ‐ The other that steers the aircraft according to target values that the pilot selects and the FCU windows display.",

Periodic checks on all ILS equipped runways ensure that the ILS signal quality is at the required level inside a defined envelope. Capturing the ILS glide slope within this envelope ensures that the aircraft is within the area of influence for the primary glide slope. It also ensures that the ILS signal is of sufficient quality to ensure a normal ILS glide slope capture. The ICAO envelope (fig.4) is within: 10 NM from the runway threshold +/-8° laterally from the runway centerline 0.3 x Θ up to 1.75 x Θ (Θ, being the nominal glide path angle). Make sure the aircraft is in the correct ILS envelope. Arming the approach too soon may cause a false Glide Slope interception out of the protected area, making the airplane descend outside the normal glide slope capture zone. Further information: Secondary glide slopes are an inevitable characteristic due to the ILS antenna design. When an aircraft flies well above the main glide slope, the glide slope deviations displayed on the PFD will refer to the nearest glide slope, which may be a secondary glide slope instead of the primary one. This can lead both the flight crew and the autopilot to erroneously consider the secondary glide slope as the reference for the final descent.",

Therefore, besides the autopilot (for obvious reasons) it is the primary source of information during an automatic landing. The transition from one phase to another during the autoland is based on the height measured by the radio altimeter. For example, at 50 ft AGL the glideslope signal is disconnected, and between 50 ft AGL and touch down, the autopilot will keep a vertical speed depending on the radio altimeter height, as this is more precise than the barometric altitude. The higher the VS the sooner the aircraft will start to flare. The auto-thrust is also incorporated in the Autoland system as this provides automatic speed control until touchdown. The pilot will retard the thrust levers at about 10-20 ft (RA) before touchdown.",

The V/S guidance has priority over the speed guidance. If the selected target V/S is too high (relative to the current thrust condition and speed), the FMGC will steer the aircraft to the target V/S, but the aircraft will also accelerate or decelerate. As altitude increases and the air gets thinner, the IAS will reduce for a given pitch setting. Consequently, the angle of attack also reduces. As a result, the vertical speed will reduce for a certain pitch attitude. The autopilot will therefore chase the selected vertical speed by pitching up. This results in further decreased IAS.

Unfortunately, we haven't been able to obtain this image as of now. When we do acquire it, this question will be updated accordingly. Thank you for your understanding! The primary distinction between the Flight Director System (FDS) and the autopilot lies in their operational roles. The FDS exclusively offers control and guidance instructions to either the pilot or the autopilot, whereas the autopilot physically controls the aircraft's surfaces. The FDS, however, serves as a precise means of cross-verifying the control and guidance commands sent to the autopilot. The FDS can be employed in the following ways: • Flight director mode only: In this scenario, the pilot manually operates the flight controls, adhering to the FDS commands. This typically occurs during the final stages of an approach, particularly for non-automated landings. • Autopilot mode only: Here, the pilot provides sensory guidance to the autopilot via the aircraft's control column/stick. This often happens when pilots are using the autopilot in control wheel steering (CWS) mode. • Flight director and autopilot mode: In this mode, the autopilot adjusts the aircraft's control surfaces in response to the steering commands issued by the FDS. This is common during cruising and most other phases of a commercial transport flight. The modes and control panel are the same for both the Flight Director (FD) and the autopilot. The FD will present on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) the instructions that the autopilot is following to meet the preset parameters.",

The system requires a minimum of three autopilots. Alert Height The alert height is a specified radio altimeter height, based on the characteristics of the aircraft and its fail operational landing system. In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aircraft, the approach would be discontinued, and a go-around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert height, it would be ignored, and the approach would be continued to complete the autoland. If below the alert height all autopilots disengage, the ILS signal is lost, excessive ILS deviations occur, or the radio-altimeter fails, a warning will be triggered and an autoland procedure will not be possible.",

At 30 ft RA, the AP/FD aligns the yaw axis with the runway centreline and the aircraft flares on the pitch axis. If the autothrust is active, thrust is automatically reduced to IDLE. When both AP/FDs are disengaged, FLARE mode disengages. After main landing gear touchdown, the autopilot (if engaged) sends a nose down order. FLARE MODE - Boeing The A/P flare manoeuvre starts at approximately 50 feet RA and is completed at touchdown: FLARE engaged is annunciated and F/D command bars retract. the A/T begins retarding thrust at approximately 27 feet RA so as to reach idle at touchdown.

Please put any further exam feedback you can remember in the comments or send by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much. Pilot-induced oscillations are where the pilot \"over-controls\" the aircraft, and therefore, will not only correct for an incorrect attitude, altitude, speed, etc., but will over-correct, and go through the equilibrium, ending up in the opposite scenario. This can often be seen on a pilot's first few ILS approaches when they begin to get very accurate near the runway, or during the flare, when pilots sometimes over-flare, and end up porpoising (up and down) along the runway. It is very common in many stages of flight, and something to try and avoid. Autopilots can perform self-induced oscillations too, if they are not quick enough to catch the overcontrolling with their feedback loop, for example. This could be in pitch, or in yaw and roll (which could lead to Dutch roll). This question is very vague, it does not tell us what oscillations we are feeling, nor much about how they have been formed, so we have chosen the most vague answer that is correct (it could also be Dutch roll, but we would have to make a lot more assumptions, so we think that \"Dutch roll\" is not as correct).",

Please let us know if you see this in the Instrumentation exam, thank you! The Fly-By-Wire system has multiple redundancies that offer layered protection: Normal Law offers all the protections (like stall, load factor etc). This is the system in operation during normal flights. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode Flight Mode Flare Mode Alternate Law offers limited protection including stability, load factor and stall protections. Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "ALERT HEIGHT The alert height is evaluated and defined during the aircraft certification. It refers only to autoland operations with fail-operational landing system. The alert height defines the point during an approach with the lowest minima (CAT IIIB): - Before which (above AH) a go-around (or full manual take-over) should be decided and initiated if a single failure affects the fail-operational landing system (the probability of a second failure remains high and must be considered); - After which (below AH), if a single failure affects the fail-operational landing system, the approach and autoland can be continued (the probability of a second failure is negligible). FAIL-OPERATIONAL AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the remaining part of the automatic system allows the aircraft to complete the approach, flare, and landing. In the event of a failure, the automatic landing system operates as a fail-passive system. FAIL-PASSIVE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail passive means in case of a failure of any part of the system, the autoland system will turn itself off and the crew has to take over. An example of an autoland sequence: - Approach (APP) mode armed - Localizer and Glide Slope Armed - Localizer Capture - Glide Slope Capture - 400 - 330 feet RA: If FLARE is armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage. - At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA: The FLARE mode is automatically engaged - Roll-out FAILURES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS As a general rule, if a failure occurs above 1000 ft AGL, the approach may be continued if all required actions are completed, the updated approach briefing is performed and the appropriate Decision heigh/altitude set. Below 1000 ft (and down to Alert Height), the occurrence of any failure requires a go around and a reassessment of the landing capability. It has been considered that below 1000 ft, not enough time is available for the crew to perform the necessary switching, to check system configuration and limitation and brief for minima.",

The options are closely corroborated between different counts of feedback, but given the question has very little information, we originally chose the only answer we could make any sense out of as correct. Recently, feedback in the comments has indicated that this answer was correct, which is encouraging to see, but please continue to send any feedback about the correct answer or the question wording, thank you! So far, we think this question could be asking about 3 different things, the last of which is our best guess: How the autopilot works out the magnitude of aileron/roll spoiler inputs to use in roll modes. How the autopilot works out the maximum bank angle. How the autopilot works out how much bank angle to use for a specific turn. 1) In this question, the autopilot mainly takes input from the IAS/CAS, as the higher the CAS, the more sensitive the controls will be, so the lass aileron/roll spoiler input needed. It may also take altitude into account, due to the low aerodynamic damping at high altitude, which may be taken into consideration. Of course, the precise amount of deflection needed is created using a feedback loop, but the autopilot does need some inputs to make the process better. 2) In managed lateral modes (sometimes called LNAV for lateral navigation), the autopilot chooses the maximum bank angle that it can use independently of the pilots, and this takes into account high altitude effects, restrictions whilst at low altitude, etc. For this, it will use altitude input, and perhaps CAS/Mach No. inputs, but crucially, we do NOT think this requires a TAS or vertical speed input, as they would not give any useful information to our knowledge. 3) The managed lateral (LNAV) modes mentioned above calculate what angle of bank to perform a turn at, in order to make that turn correctly, following the calculated path. This requires input of the aircraft TAS, as well as some distances (from waypoint to waypoint, aircraft to waypoint, aircraft to the track when intercepting, etc.). As far as we can tell, this is the only interpretation of the question that actually gives a somewhat correct answer, even though the interpretation is a bit of a push and the answer is very vague, so we certainly do not like it.",

The automatic landing will be achieved by using several onboard instruments: the radio altimeter, the autopilot, and the auto-throttle. The successful completion of an automatic landing depends on various items such as the crosswind, headwind, tailwind, runway contamination, etc. that need to be within a certain range. Beyond the certified range of these variables, the automatic landing cannot be completed safely. As surprising as it might be, the Autoland capability can be useful on other occasions. For example, when both flight crew experience extreme fatigue and don’t take the risk of landing manually the aircraft, they can agree on an automatic landing. Obviously, this is not because the pilot flying will misjudge the flare or anything that is linked with the manual skills (although it could also be the cause), but mostly because if a go-around were to be executed, the autopilot would greatly reduce the workload and help the pilots to seat back and carefully manage the flight path of the airplane, flaps retraction, and missed approach procedure monitoring.",

With CWS engaged, the A/P manoeuvres the aeroplane in response to control pressures applied by either pilot. The control pressure is similar to that required for manual flight. When control pressure is released, the A/P holds existing attitude. Touch Control Steering (TCS) Touch Control Steering (TCS) also permits a pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch or roll, but unlike CWS the appropriate automatic control channels and servomotors are disengaged while the TCS button is held depressed allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in the desired attitude using manual control.

The required visual reference for a manual landing is elements of the approach light system, threshold, threshold markings, threshold identification lights, visual glideslope indicator (PAPI), touchdown zone markings, touchdown zone lights and runway edge lights. The issue with this question is that typically in a large transport aircraft, ‘FLARE’ mode would engage at around 30/50 ft radio altitude. The time delay between 30/50 ft RA and touchdown is around 2 seconds. So, for the pilot monitoring to call “NO FLARE” and the pilot flying to take manual control and land at this late stage is basically impossible. Should the ‘FLARE’ mode not activate, the likely scenario would be for the aircraft to continue to descend and autoland onto the runway with a rate of descent of approximately 700 fpm. A firm but likely safe landing would arise. Alternatively, the pilot flying may wish to execute a go around/baulked landing manoeuvrer. Note: You may wish to consider appealing the question, depending on the wording in your actual exam. Alternatively consider that the remaining ‘incorrect’ options suggest taking manual control after the landing, which by then is too late.",

The decision height is the height on the approach at which the pilot must see the required visual reference to continue to land. The visual reference is basically either the physical runway, its markings (paint) or an element of the approach lighting. In real life, it will be the lights that will shine to find you first. If the required visual reference can not be established at DH, then a Go-Around will result. However, the Go-Around mode can be selected above DH if needed and infact even once landed. For example, on the B737 the mode remains available up to 2 seconds after touch down. Note: Go-Around basically tells the autopilot to pitch up with wings level and the autothrust to select a high thrust setting for climb out. The pilot must retract the gear and flaps as practical.",

The gyros will then send a signal to a detector (=signal processor) that is proportional to the rate of change of attitude. The detector that has received this signal will compute a corrective signal and will send it to the elevator servo motors. After the elevator has been moved, feedback of the elevator position is sent to the detector so that the actual position of the elevator and the required one is compared. If the elevator still hasn’t achieved its required position, the detector unit will compute another corrective signal proportional to the new displacement.

FAIL-OPERATIONAL AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the remaining part of the automatic system allows the aircraft to complete the approach, flare, and landing. In the event of a failure, the automatic landing system operates as a fail-passive system. FAIL-PASSIVE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail passive means in case of a failure of any part of the system, the autoland system will turn itself off and the crew has to take over. An example of an autoland sequence: - Approach (APP) mode armed - Localizer and Glide Slope Armed - Localizer Capture - Glide Slope Capture - 400 - 330 feet RA: If FLARE is armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage. - At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA: The FLARE mode is automatically engaged - Roll-out FAILURES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS As a general rule, if a failure occurs above 1000 ft AGL, the approach may be continued if all required actions are completed, the updated approach briefing is performed and the appropriate Decision heigh/altitude set. Below 1000 ft (and down to Alert Height), the occurrence of any failure requires a go around and a reassessment of the landing capability. It has been considered that below 1000 ft, not enough time is available for the crew to perform the necessary switching, to check system configuration and limitation and brief for minima.",

The AP and FD pitch modes can control a target SPD/MACH or a vertical trajectory, and the A/THR mode can control a fixed thrust or a target SPD/MACH. However, the AP/FD and the A/THR cannot both control a target SPD/MACH simultaneously. Therefore the AP/FD pitch modes and A/THR mode are coordinated as follows: ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a vertical trajectory, the A/THR mode controls the target SPD/MACH. ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a target SPD or MACH, the A/THR mode controls the thrust. ‐ If no AP/FD pitch mode is engaged, the A/THR mode reverts to controlling the SPD/MACH mode. In other words, the selection of an AP/FD pitch mode determines which mode the A/THR controls. The FMGS has guidance parameters for both AP/FD lateral and vertical modes. The AP/FD lateral modes are the same. Two types of autopilot and flight director modes are available to guide the aircraft: ‐ One that steers the aircraft along the lateral, vertical, and speed profiles according to the data the pilot inserts into the MCDU. Flight Management (in the Flight Management and Guidance Computer) computes the corresponding guidance targets. ‐ The other that steers the aircraft according to target values that the pilot selects and the FCU windows display.",

Additionally, systems which are not directly involved in the autoland sequency can also affect the ability to perform automatic landing and probably result in higher minima. Thus, the pilot must check the FCOM to verify whether the failure has any impact on the aircraft's approach capability. In case the defect causes a reduction in the aircraft's approach capability, a diversion or higher height and/or RVR might be necessary. Note: Two students have confirmed that the correct answer supported the idea that autoland capability is affected since visual contact is important during the last stage of landing.",

The only circumstance that would trigger a go-around below the alert height is the activation of the \"autoland warning light.\" This light indicates the system's absolute inability to complete the automatic landing and can be caused by factors such as dual autopilot failure, loss of ILS (Instrument Landing System) localizer and/or glide slope signals, excessive deviations from the ILS beams, or failure of a radio altimeter with significant deviations between radio altimeter readings from both sides.

In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aeroplane (including, where appropriate, ground roll guidance and the reversionary mode in a hybrid system), the approach would be discontinued and a go-around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible.

Touch Control Steering (TCS) Touch Control Steering (TCS) also permits a pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch or roll, but unlike CWS the appropriate automatic control channels and servomotors are disengaged while the TCS button is held depressed allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in the desired attitude using manual control.

These conditions vary slightly between autopilots, but take the form of a number of switches called interlocks, connected in series.

Aircraft Handling Errors Errors associated with the flight path and configuration of the aircraft (e.g.automation errors, mis-selections, incorrect speed, heading, altitude, etc.). ERROR MANAGEMENT AVOID – Use the protective mechanisms built into operational policies and procedures, as well as core competencies, to minimize the possibility of error (e.g. adhere to procedures, SOPs, briefings, etc.) TRAP – Recognize and correct errors, before they become cumulative or consequential, by proper crosschecking, monitoring, using checklists, etc. MITIGATE – Lessen the effect of errors that have not been avoided or trapped by changing your course of action e.g. going around, diverting, holding, etc.",

When in the plane, the Captain sits on the left-hand side and the First Officer sits on the right-hand side. Before each flight the crew agrees on which pilot will act as the Pilot Flying (PF) and which will act as the Pilot Monitoring (PM) for that particular flight. Each of them has a different area of responsibility in the cockpit. The Pilot Flying (PF) must concentrate on \"flying the aircraft\" to monitor and control the pitch attitude, bank angle, airspeed, thrust, sideslip, heading, etc., in order to achieve and maintain the desired targets, vertical flight path, and lateral flight path. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) must assist the PF and must actively monitor flight parameters, call out any excessive deviation and is responsible for radio communication with ATC, flight attendants, and passengers. Furthermore, he/she maintains the flight plan, monitors fuel, reads checklists, and operates the landing gear and flaps. Therefore, both flight crewmembers must: • Focus and concentrate on their tasks to ensure appropriate task sharing • Maintain situational awareness and immediately resolve any uncertainty as a crew.",

By definition, PIO (or APC) cannot happen unless the pilot is making inputs that are sustaining the oscillation. Consequently, the first and most critical step for exiting PIO is to get out of the loop. This presents three primary possibilities: - The pilot freezes the controls - The pilot releases the controls - The pilot significantly reduces the aggressiveness of control input",

Think about the last phase of the approach, most of the time you will leave the FDs ON after disconnecting the autopilot, and they will give you the optimum indications to remain on your glideslope and localizer beam until the touchdown.",

The term \"servomechanism\" (sometimes shortened to \"servo\") could be defined as: An automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the performance of a mechanism and is defined by its function. In other words, a servo-system operates on the principle of using a some sort of detection device to automatically monitor the state of a particular system or a component (parameters, position, etc.). Any difference between the detected values and desired values is treated as an error condition. In such cases the difference value (error signal) is amplified and then used by the corrective mechanism (e.g. an electric motor) to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error. Servos are frequently used in the position control systems. They are typically electrical or partially electronic in nature, using an electric motor as the primary means of creating the mechanical corrective force. Other types of servos use hydraulics, pneumatics, or magnetic principles. In aircraft systems, we can usually find servo-mechanisms in the autopilot systems (e.g. position control of the respective flight control surfaces), instruments (e.g. maintaining the vertical of a gyroscope), etc. Note: if you still have difficulties grasping the understanding of the principle behind a \"servo\" then let's take a look at two common car systems: • Electrically Controlled Car Windows: When you press the button to move the car window up or down, an electric motor is operated to move the actual window pane. Is this another example of a servo-system? No, because the action (e.g. motor opening the window) was based on a manual user input => you had to press the \"open\" button to get that window down. • Car Cruise Control System: You are driving down the highway and you set your cruise control at 130 km/h (desired state). The highway starts to go uphill suddenly and your cruise control system immediately detects the speed starting to decrease (detection mechanism). In other words, an error occurred - there is a difference between the desired and actually detected states. The system, therefore, applies a force to eliminate this error => the cruise control system adds more gas to compensate for the uphill terrain and brings the speed back up to the preselected usually so quickly the driver doesn't even notice any speed drop. Is this an example of a servo system? Of course, it is - we have an automatic error detection + error correction.",

Before each flight the crew agrees on which pilot will act as the Pilot Flying (PF) and which will act as the Pilot Monitoring (PM) for that particular flight. Each of them has a different area of responsibility in the cockpit. The Pilot Flying (PF) must concentrate on \"flying the aircraft\" to monitor and control the pitch attitude, bank angle, airspeed, thrust, sideslip, heading, etc., in order to achieve and maintain the desired targets, vertical flight path, and lateral flight path. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) must assist the PF and must actively monitor flight parameters, call out any excessive deviation and is responsible for radio communication with ATC, flight attendants, and passengers. Furthermore, he/she maintains the flight plan, monitors fuel, reads checklists, and operates the landing gear and flaps.

Fail operational - The automatic landing system consists of three independent autopilot channels per controlled axis, it is capable of determining the failed component and excluding it from the computation. In the event of a failure, the approach, flare, and landing can be completed by the remaining part of the automatic system. Therefore, looking at each option: \"maintain safe flight, but is unable to complete the automatic landing.\" Correct. Whilst the \"maintain safe flight\" is debatable, as the autopilot will eventually disconnect to allow the pilots to perform the landing manually or make a go-around, the fail passive system makes sure that there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, which you could consider to mean that it is safe flight, and the aircraft is not able to complete the autoland after such a problem. It is therefore most correct. \"complete the automatic landing, including the landing roll-out to a full stop.\" The aircraft can no longer complete the automatic landing after a failure on a fail-passive system. \"maintain safe flight, providing the autoland capability but without auto-flare.\" The autoland capability doesn't exist without auto-flare, and the autoland capability is gone when a fail-passive system has a failure of some kind. \"complete the automatic landing, but unable to provide roll-out guidance.\" The aircraft can no longer complete the automatic landing after a failure on a fail-passive system.",

This is the third similar question about this topic we have in our database, and all appear to have quite significantly different options at least. Failure or malfunctions of any of the systems required to perform an automatic landing can result in a degradation of autoland performance. Additionally, systems which are not directly involved in the autoland sequency can also affect the ability to perform automatic landing and sometimes result in higher minima. Thus, the pilot must check the relevant manuals, such as the FCOM, QRH or MEL to verify whether the failure has any impact on the aircraft's approach capability. In case the defect causes a reduction in the aircraft's approach capability, a diversion or higher decision height and/or RVR might be necessary. Whilst I have never personally seen an aircraft or company procedure that requires windshield heating to be available for autoland, there are often requirements for windshield wipers to be operative, etc., as visual reference can be very important in the late stages of the approach and the landing. To go through each option: \"Yes, because the windshield heating system is not essential for the autoland procedure.\" This is not necessarily always the case, and we cannot just assume that the windshield heating system is not a part of the required equipment. \"No, because autoland requires all aircraft systems to be fully operational.\" Not always; the autoland has a certain amount of required equipment, but not everything is necessary. The specific requirements will be laid out in the company or aircraft manuals. \"Yes, as long as the weather conditions are clear, and there is no need for visibility enhancement.\" Well the whole point of an autoland is an automatically flown approach and landing in poor visibility, so the weather conditions are not clear. \"No, unless approved by the airline's manuals and the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) procedures are followed.\" Correct (mostly). We have to assume \"no\" until we find the list of required equipment for the autoland in the manuals, or reference documents such as the QRH for any restrictions caused by the loss of windshield heating. After checking these, only then can we perform the autoland if we are happy that it is allowed with such a defect. MEL procedures need not be followed as the problem has been found in the air, and MEL is a document used to check requirements before dispatch. Nonetheless, this is the most correct answer.",

The Fail-Operational Automatic Landing System A fail-operational automatic landing system is defined as the capability of a system to withstand a failure without affecting the overall functioning of the system and without causing degradation of performance beyond the limits required for an automatic landing. The system requires a minimum of three autopilots. Alert Height The alert height is a specified radio altimeter height, based on the characteristics of the aircraft and its fail operational landing system. In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aircraft, the approach would be discontinued, and a go-around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert height, it would be ignored, and the approach would be continued to complete the autoland. If below the alert height all autopilots disengage, the ILS signal or components are lost, excessive ILS deviations occur, or the radio-altimeter fails, a warning will be triggered and an autoland procedure will not be possible. Fail passive - The automatic landing system is fed by only two fail-safe autopilots comparing their computations, therefore it cannot determine which one of the units is delivering the correct steering commands. In the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail operational - The automatic landing system consists of three independent autopilot channels per controlled axis, it is capable of determining the failed component and excluding it from the computation. In the event of a failure, the approach, flare, and landing can be completed by the remaining part of the automatic system.",

The HDG V/S -TRK FPA pb on the FCU allows the flight crew to select either type of reference to be used for guidance and for display on the PFD (figure 1) The FMGC pitch mode guides the aircraft to the target V/S or FPA. The corresponding A/THR mode is SPEED or MACH. The V/S (FPA) guidance has priority over the speed guidance. If the selected target V/S or FPA is too high (relative to the current thrust condition and speed), the FMGC will steer the aircraft to the target V/S or FPA, but the aircraft will also accelerate or decelerate. VERTICAL SPEED An aircraft's vertical speed is the positive or negative rate of altitude change with respect to time. This is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min). The Vertical Speed in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). FLIGHT PATH ANGLE (figure 2) The Flight Path Angle is the angle between the Aircraft’s Velocity Vector and the Horizon. If you are flying in a level flight your Flight Path Angle will be zero (over the horizon), regardless of the Pitch Angle. During a descent, the Flight Path Angle will be negative (below the horizon) thus when climbing the Flight Path Angle will be positive (over the horizon).

The navigation database cannot be modified; however, it has some additional storage space where the flight crew can create and store additional waypoints, routes, navaids, etc. they might need along their route. An example of an additional waypoint could be some Decision Points, which coordinates are indicated in the Operational Flight Plan the crew receives during the briefing. On a several sectors day, it is very common that the pilot stores the flight back (the second sector) on this additional storage of the navigation database. For instance, the FMS2 Honeywell Release 1A, allows the flight crew to create and store up to 99 waypoints, 10 runways, 20 navaids, and 5 routes. This will be different from one FMS to another, but it already gives you an idea of the capability of the additional storage space of the navigation database, called the supplemental navigation database. Caution! It is really important to understand and make the difference that pilots can use the Supplemental Navigation database to write and read information => by adding their own customized waypoint or other navigation data. BUT this is limited to ONLY this Supplemental Nav database! At the time of the Main Nav database update (every 28 days) the Supp Nav database is automatically erased. It makes sense as the Supp Nav database could include waypoints that have been defined using waypoints contained in the Main Nav database that may have changed as a result of the update.",

This function will basically make internal calculations based on the aircraft weight, its cruising level, and the actual and expected wind conditions en-route to estimate the remaining fuel quantity along the flight plan. Most of the time this tool is very accurate, but the number of parameters influencing the fuel consumption makes it difficult to exactly predict the fuel consumption. That’s why you always need to do fuel checks at regular intervals during the flight and check that the fuel consumption is normal, the remaining fuel to destination is still the same, and there’s no leak. The FMS has also the ability to provide correct fuel computations even in engine-out configuration. This greatly reduces the flight crew’s workload, especially under such stressful conditions.",

The FMC provides the primary navigation, flight planning, and optimized terminal routes and en route guidance for the aircraft and is typically comprised of interrelated functions such as navigation, flight planning, trajectory prediction, performance computations, and guidance. The FMC and associated databases are an essential part of modern airline avionics. An FMC typically contains three databases in addition to the basic operational flight program (OFP). The first is a software options database which activates the optional functionality contained in the OFP that is desired by the operator. The second is the model and engine performance database and contains all the aircraft performance data which allows the FMC to compute fuel burn, optimum altitudes and airspeeds, etc. The third is the Navigation Database (NDB). The NDB is contains all the information required for building a flight plan and processing that plan when airborne. All these databases are stored in the FMC on an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) card. Each of these databases can be updated via a data loader every 28 days. AIRAC updated every 28 days contains read only data but the pilot is still able to enter fixes, phantom stations and adjust parameters according to how he needs it within certain limits The NDB contains terminal and en route fixes; waypoints and navigation reference system (NRS) grid points; intersections; airways and radio navigation aids. It also contains airports; runways; STAR and SID; holding patterns; and instrument approaches such as VOR, non-directional beacon, area navigation (RNAV), required navigation performance (RNP), satellite based navigation system (SBAS), and ground based navigation system (GBAS).",

A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength.

ADC - The FMS collects all the information provided by the ADC. Most of them are only indirectly used, however, all of them are used for monitoring and recording purposes that you can access at any time. AS an example of a direct application, vertical navigation management is generally performed based on the baro altitude input from the ADC. In the same way, the managed vertical guidance of the FMS can command a flight path angle or a speed target, and both of these parameters require inputs from the ADC. Aircraft position - The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and the GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Data from the FMC navigation database - The navigation database of the FMC contains all the information that would normally be obtained from the navigation charts. For instance, you would find navaids, airports, runways, approaches (with constraints, specific features), STARs, SIDs, and company routes. In each aircraft, the FMC has two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days. Each of them conforms to a revision cycle that the crew will check and select during the cockpit preparation, usually done by the pilot flying who sets up the FMC. The nav database is updated by maintenance every 28 days.",

            "explanation": "GPS POSITION The Flight Management Computer (FMGC) computes its own aircraft position ('FM' position) from an IRS position and a computed radio position, or a GPS position. Each IRS computes a mixed IRS/GPS position called the GPIRS position. For this, each IRS can independently select their GPS source in order to maximize the availability of GPS data. If the GPIRS data does not comply with an integrity criterion that is based on a Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) and on the automatic detection of failed satellites, the FMS rejects the GPS mode and uses the radio position update. The flight crew can deselect/select the GPS position on the SELECTED NAVAIDS page, if necessary. Without GPS PRIMARY (GPS deselected or inoperative) the navigation accuracy is lower and is a function of ground radio navaid infrastructure or elapsed time since the last radio update. RNAV(GNSS) approaches may be performed, provided GPS PRIMARY is available and with AP or FD engaged. The flight crew may check the position computation using the POSITION MONITOR page. RAIM Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitor (RAIM) is a form of integrity monitoring performed within the avionics themselves. It ensures available satellite signals meet the integrity requirements for a given phase of flight. By comparing the distance measurements of a number of satellites, the RAIM function can identify a satellite failure and issue an alert to the pilot. Without RAIM capability, the pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position. A minimum of five satellites is required to detect a bad satellite; at least six satellites are required to detect and exclude a bad satellite from the navigation solution if your receiver has a fault detection and exclusion (FDE) RAIM algorithm.",

The FMS uses a position that is a combination of the IRS position, GPS position and radio position (auto-tuning ground nav-aids). The FMS selects the best-calculated position based on a figure of merit and priority, called a Kalman Filter. For instance, GPS is the most accurate indication of position, so is usually the main input, but when that is no longer accurate enough, the FMS has to use the IRS and radio position, also depending on their current availability. Of course, IRS position is the most available data, as it does not require external information, but radio position is often more accurate, when available.

The FMS selects the best-calculated position based on a figure of merit and priority, called a Kalman Filter. For instance, GPS is the most accurate indication of position, so is usually the main input, but when that is no longer accurate enough, the FMS has to use the IRS and radio position, also depending on their current availability. Of course, IRS position is the most available data, as it does not require external information, but radio position is often more accurate, when available. Modern FMS systems are very clever, and can automatically deselect GPS inputs if they become erroneous or lose signal, however, this is detrimental to the accuracy of the system, and will then have to use less accurate position data. This means that the aircraft may have a different position to what is calculated by the FMS, due to this lack of accuracy.

Additionally, the bearing needles could also be displayed. The navaids are automatically tuned from the received signal and the navigation database of the FMS. The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and the GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. The output of all this visible on the EFIS is the aircraft position along the flight plan route, its offset (when under radar vectoring), and any relative position from a navaid, airport, obstacle. The TCAS and AWR are standalone systems that are not interacting with the FMS. Therefore, the outputs displayed on the EFIS are not from the FMS.",

In order for the FMS to make correct predictions, it is vital that the aircraft performance database contains correct data – calculations based on incorrect data will result in false computations and may be a threat to flight safety. Performance databases are based on the aircraft type, model, and engines fitted. This is why they do not go \"out of date\" like a navigation database does. The pilot must input the correct information from the load sheet and OFP (Operational Flight Plan) into the database before flight, which includes weights, centre of gravity positions, fuel quantities, and the performance degradation figure. The performance degradation figure is a value to allows the aircraft FMS (Flight Management System) to account for the increased drag and fuel burn of an older airframe. Note: Current feedback gives the \"up to date\" answer as correct. We believe that this should not be correct, and we think there may be some confusion possible between similar questions, some of which are talking about the navigation database rather than the performance database.

This greatly reduces the flight crew’s workload, especially under such stressful conditions. Aid with navigation - lateral and vertical flight plan management: The FMS calculates the aircraft trajectory so that it respects any inserted constraints (altitude, speed, distance, etc. Aircraft position computation - The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength. Workload is greatly reduced because the flight crew only need to cross-check with their charts that the correct frequencies are automatically inserted.",

The navigation database cannot be modified; however, it has some additional storage space where the flight crew can create and store additional waypoints, routes, navaids, etc. they might need along their route. An example of an additional waypoint could be some Decision Points, which coordinates are indicated in the Operational Flight Plan the crew receives during the briefing. On a several sectors day, it is very common that the pilot stores the flight back (the second sector) on this additional storage of the navigation database. For instance, the FMS2 Honeywell Release 1A, allows the flight crew to create and store up to 99 waypoints, 10 runways, 20 navaids, and 5 routes. This will be different from one FMS to another, but it already gives you an idea of the capability of the additional storage space of the navigation database, called the supplemental navigation database. Caution! It is really important to understand and make the difference that pilots can use the Supplemental Navigation database to write and read information => by adding their own customized waypoint or other navigation data. BUT this is limited to ONLY this Supplemental Nav database! At the time of the Main Nav database update (every 28 days) the Supp Nav database is automatically erased. It makes sense as the Supp Nav database could include waypoints that have been defined using waypoints contained in the Main Nav database that may have changed as a result of the update.",

Both systems are usually interconnected in a way that allows pilot entries made in one system to be transferred to the other unit. If one unit fails, the other FMS unit can still operate in “independent mode”, which provides less precision. In this architecture (dual FMS), a malfunction of the cross-talk bus may occur, where both FMS units will continue fully operational, as they perform all computations based on separate data. However, automatic alerts in the event of deviations between both units can no longer be issued, meaning that pilots will have to verify correct functions themselves.

Maintenance can refine the database for each aircraft by entering factors for drag and fuel flow Generally, in the cockpit preparation phase and before starting to program the FMGS, the pilots will check both databases. The performance database is checked by confirming the Engine and Aircraft type as well as the performance factor.

Aid with navigation - lateral and vertical flight plan management: The FMS calculates the aircraft trajectory so that it respects any inserted constraints (altitude, speed, distance, etc. Aircraft position computation - The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength. Workload is greatly reduced because the flight crew only need to cross-check with their charts that the correct frequencies are automatically inserted.",

The Flight Management System helps to reduce the flight crew’s workload by providing several extremely useful functions. One of those functions is the aid for fuel management that helps improving fuel efficiency and in-flight performance. This function will basically make internal calculations based on the aircraft weight, its cruising level, and the actual and expected wind conditions en-route to estimate the remaining fuel quantity along the flight plan. Most of the time this tool is very accurate, but the number of parameters influencing the fuel consumption makes it difficult to exactly predict the fuel consumption. That’s why you always need to do fuel checks at regular intervals during the flight and check that the fuel consumption is normal, the remaining fuel to the destination is still the same, and there’s no leak.",

The FMC provides the primary navigation, flight planning, and optimized terminal routes and en route guidance for the aircraft and is typically comprised of interrelated functions such as navigation, flight planning, trajectory prediction, performance computations, and guidance. The FMC and associated databases are an essential part of modern airline avionics. An FMC typically contains three databases in addition to the basic operational flight program (OFP). The first is a software options database which activates the optional functionality contained in the OFP that is desired by the operator. The second is the model and engine performance database and contains all the aircraft performance data which allows the FMC to compute fuel burn, optimum altitudes and airspeeds, etc. The third is the navigation database (NDB). The NDB contains all the information required for building a flight plan and processing that plan when airborne. All these databases are stored in the FMC on an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) card. Each of these databases can be updated via a data loader. The NDB contains terminal and en route fixes; waypoints and navigation reference system (NRS) grid points; intersections; airways and radio navigation aids. It also contains airports; runways; STAR and SID; holding patterns; and instrument approaches such as VOR, non-directional beacon, area navigation (RNAV), required navigation performance (RNP), satellite based navigation system (SBAS), and ground based navigation system (GBAS). Note: Additional space is provided between the NDB to save navigational data created by the pilot",

The Flight Management Computer (FMC) holds two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days to align with the standard revision cycle for navigation charts. Prior to flight, the flight crew can designate the active set, which the FMC employs for navigation computations. The maintenance department updates the contents of these navigation databases every 28 days. By the time the navigation chart revision date arrives, the new data is already integrated into the FMC and available for selection. Should pilots mistakenly switch navigation databases while on the ground or in-flight, it could compromise elements of the planned flight route, potentially leading to hazardous deviations in performance and navigation. In the best case, such an error may result in a flight plan discontinuity - this is typically flagged by multiple FMS warnings. However, there's also the possibility that the FMS can still adhere to the flight plan, albeit leading the aircraft along an unexpected path, causing both pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel to lose situational awareness. This scenario could potentially result in perilous close encounters between aircraft.",

Therefore, in order to let the FMS to conducting all the vertical navigation, your aircraft definitely needs an autothrottle system. On a large commercial aircraft, the auto-throttle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. Find in this table, the summary of the autothrottle modes of operation and the respective flight phase: Flight phase Autothrottle mode Meaning Ground / TO roll N1 hold autothrottle commands full thrust for take-off. Climb IAS hold autothrottle commands full thrust for climb and the desired speed is maintained by the AP pitch channel. Climb with V/S IAS hold autothrottle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Cruise / ALT hold IAS/MACH hold autothrottle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Approach IAS hold autothrottle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed.",

According to our perspective, we believe that option D, which states, \"There is NO problem as the inserted quantity will be automatically updated to the actual value,\" should be considered the correct answer. If you encounter this question during your official exam, we kindly request you to inform us about it. MCDU INIT FUEL PRED PAGE The pilot uses this page to initialise the gross weight, center of gravity and block fuel, before starting the engines. The FMGC will stop using the pilot-entered block fuel and will compute its predictions based on the FOB indicated by the FQI computer after the first engine start. BLOCK: Crew may enter a block fuel for planning purposes. However, the FMS will take the fuel onboard from the fuel quantity indication system. After the aircraft is refuelled, the pilots should: - Check that the indicated Fuel On Board (FOB) corresponds to the Flight Plan - Check that if any imbalance is present, it is within the limits - compare the planned and actual uplift in mass (kgs or lbs). This will allow to identify any error or discrepancy that happened during the refuelling process. These discrepancies are generally limited by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and if out of limits a maintenance action is due.",

The FMS (Flight Management System) is the main computer that the pilots use to interface with the aircraft's more complex systems. Before a flight, the pilots will spend many minutes checking through the various pages in the FMS, making sure the data is correct, and inputting things such as the route, weights, clearances, temperatures, etc. The pilots can input many of these items from the OFP (Operational Flight Plan) which is part of the briefing pack the pilots have before the flight. Some of this data, however, such as updated weights and centre of gravity locations, arrive on the load sheet handed to the PIC by the dispatcher. The values on the load sheet then have to be checked/inputted into the FMS to make sure that the weights and CofG limits are correct for the flight. There are also databases in the FMS, and these are comprised of the navigation database and the performance database. These both need to be checked. The navigation database must be checked for time validity and the performance database must be checked to see if it contains the correct data, for example if it pertains to the correct aircraft variant with the correct engines. The alternate airport routing would not normally be entered into the FMS, unless it was expected to be used soon after take-off, which of course would be a scenario where taking off is not advisable in the first place. We do not input destination weather on most systems (and certainly not before take off).",

This makes it easier for engineers to be able to update the aircraft standby databases in the few days leading up to the change-over. In the rare case that an aircraft is flying through the change-over, the pilots should NOT change the database in the air, as database corruption could make their avionics unusable if it goes wrong, so should remain on the old database, and check their routings, SIDs, STARs, and all waypoints with charts and can check the update notes (and NOTAMs) to see what has changed also. As long as their routes are still correct, and some other items mentioned in the annex above, the flight is still allowed. Note: This question has been moved from incorrectly placed feedback in AGK. The correct answer is also missing quite a bit of detail, which does make it slightly ambiguous, so if anyone has further exam feedback about this, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com.",

The master FMC sends its commands to the autopilot, the flight director system, and the autothrottle/collective. Independent mode – Both FMCs are decoupled and there’s ZERO cross-checking between them. This mode is automatically selected by the FMS under certain abnormal conditions such as different database validity on both FMCs.

This greatly reduces the flight crew’s workload, especially under such stressful conditions. Aid with navigation - lateral and vertical flight plan management: The FMS calculates the aircraft trajectory so that it respects any inserted constraints (altitude, speed, distance, etc. Aircraft position computation: The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning – automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength. The workload is greatly reduced because the flight crew only need to cross-check with their charts that the correct frequencies are automatically inserted.",

Each IRS computes a mixed IRS/GPS position called the GPIRS position. For this, each IRS can independently select their GPS source in order to maximize the availability of GPS data. If the GPIRS data does not comply with an integrity criterion that is based on a Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) and on the automatic detection of failed satellites, the FMS rejects the GPS mode and uses the radio position update. The flight crew can deselect/select the GPS position on the SELECTED NAVAIDS page, if necessary. Without GPS PRIMARY (GPS deselected or inoperative) the navigation accuracy is lower and is a function of ground radio navaid infrastructure or elapsed time since the last radio update. RNAV(GNSS) approaches may be performed, provided GPS PRIMARY is available and with AP or FD engaged. The flight crew may check the position computation using the POSITION MONITOR page.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square.",

The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it uses the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS II can display up to 30 traffic simultaneously. This means that the system can handle a significant number of traffic alerts and resolution advisories at the same time, providing crucial information to the flight crew for collision avoidance. The display of these advisories is essential for the safe operation of the aircraft, especially in busy airspace where multiple aircraft may be in close proximity.",

Therefore, besides the autopilot (for obvious reasons) it is the primary source of information during an automatic landing. The transition from one phase to another during the autoland is based on the height measured by the radio altimeter. For example, at 50 ft AGL the glideslope signal is disconnected, and between 50 ft AGL and touch down, the autopilot will keep a vertical speed depending on the radio altimeter height, as this is more precise than the barometric altitude.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

The GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. However, this limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Given the location of the aircraft, its course and height (either from the ADC or derived from GPS) a display can be created showing the locations of terrain that could threaten the safety of the aircraft. Note: It is important to note that the EGPWS has the basic functions of the GPWS to which the 'look ahead' function is added. This means that the EGPWS also relies on the Radar Altimeter as one of its inputs.

            "explanation": "The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square. A TCAS II provides the intruder relative position (Traffic Advisory and proximate traffic) and possibly an indication of a collision avoidance maneuver (Resolution Advisory) within the vertical plane only, by comparing the mode C pressure altitudes of the aircraft. The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay.

The radio altimeter has two other important functions: - It supplies the automatic flight system with data to affect automatic landings when used in association with the ILS / MLS. - It furnishes height information and rate of change of height to the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), and is a crucial component of this system. The instrument makes use of primary radio principles transmitting a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) in an elliptical pattern vertically below the aircraft. GPWS The aim of the system is to give visual and audible warning signals to a pilot when the aircraft’s proximity to the terrain poses a potential threat to its safety. GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ Radio Altitude and automatically selects the correct mode of operation. Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) (figure 2) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). In this exercise: Although the GPWS generated a 'TOO LOW TERRAIN', the visual references confirm that the altitude indication (FL80) and terrain clearance coincide with the expected and not with the GPWS caution. This means that this warning is either spurious or results from a system malfunction.",

The stall warning is only alerting the pilot that the aircraft has entered a stall while the stick pusher is a protection – it acts on the control column to prevent the aircraft from entering the stall conditions. The input data of the stall warning system are: Angle of Attack Configuration (slats/flaps deflection) Note: The stall warning is inhibited while on the ground.",

TAs indicate the approximate positions of intruding aircraft that may later cause an RA. RAs that propose manoeuvres in the vertical plain are predicted to increase or maintain separation from the threatening aircraft. Traffic Advisory (TA) means a caution to the flight crew that an aircraft has become a potential collision threat. Resolution Advisory (RA) means a warning to the flight crew of an imminent collision threat, combined with commands for the crew to use in avoiding an airborne collision. When an RA is produced, the pilot flying shall immediately take the corrective action indicated by the RA, even if this conflicts with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aeroplane.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

The computers receive inputs from the: - angle of attack sensor (Alpha probe) - flap position transmitter - N1 and N2 indicators - air/ground relay - air data computers - leading edge module. At a pre-set angle of attack, the circuit completes and an eccentric weight motor attached to the base of either or both control columns operates. The motor in turn vibrates the control column, thus imitating the effect of aerodynamic buffet, and alerts the flight crew before a stall develops. This also displays visually on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). In the event the angle of attack becomes frozen at a specific Angle of Attack, an increase in AoA will not be detected by the computer and a stall warning will then not be triggered.",

Please send us any further exam feedback you have about this question in the comments, as we require some more information to work out what EASA actually wants from us here, Thank you! On most modern transport aeroplanes the stall-warning device activates primarily via an angle of attack or Alpha sensor. One of these sensors is located on either side of the fuselage near the nose, and detects the change/rate of change of angle of attack of the aeroplane as the airspeed varies. Two independent digital computers are normally installed which compute the proper stall warning based on the angle of attack, flap configuration, and thrust. The computers receive inputs from: - the angle of attack sensor (Alpha probe) - the flap/slat position transmitter - the N1 and N2 indicators - the air/ground sensor - the air data computer (including CAS) When the system receives the correct signals to indicate being close enough to a stall to initiate the warning, an eccentric weight motor attached to the base of either or both control columns operates. The motor in turn vibrates the control column, thus imitating the effect of aerodynamic buffet, and alerts the flight crew before a stall develops. This also displays visually on the Primary Flight Display (PFD).",

Basic Functions: Mode 1 – Excessive Descent Rate Mode 2 – Excessive Closure to Terrain Mode 3 – Altitude Loss After Takeoff Mode 4 – Unsafe Terrain Clearance Mode 5 – Excessive Deviation Below Glideslope Mode 6 – Advisory Callouts Mode 7 – Windshear Alerting Enhanced Functions: Terrain Clearance Floor Terrain Look-ahead Alerting Windshear Alerts - Terrain Look-Ahead Alerting This is accomplished (when enabled) based on aircraft position, flight path angle, track, and speed relative to the terrain database image forward the aircraft. Through sophisticated look-ahead algorithms, both caution and warning alerts are generated if terrain or an obstacle conflict with “ribbons” projected forward of the aircraft. These ribbons project down, forward, then up from the aircraft with a width starting at 1/4 nm and extending out at ±3° laterally, more if turning. The look-down and up angles are a function of the aircraft flight path angle, and the look-down distance a function of the aircraft’s altitude with respect to the nearest or destination runway. This relationship prevents undesired alerts when taking off or landing. The look-ahead distance is a function of the aircraft’s speed, and distance to the nearest runway. A terrain conflict intruding into the caution ribbon activates EGPWS caution lights and the aural message “CAUTION TERRAIN, CAUTION TERRAIN” or “TERRAIN AHEAD, TERRAIN AHEAD”. An obstacle conflict provides a “CAUTION OBSTACLE, CAUTION OBSTACLE” or “OBSTACLE AHEAD, OBSTACLE AHEAD” message. The caution alert is given typically 60 seconds ahead of the terrain/obstacle conflict and is repeated every seven seconds as long as the conflict remains within the caution area. When the warning ribbon is intruded (typically 30 seconds prior to the terrain/obstacle conflict), EGPWS warning lights activate and the aural message “TERRAIN, TERRAIN, PULL UP” or “OBSTACLE, OBSTACLE, PULL UP” is enunciated with “PULL UP” repeating continuously while the conflict is within the warning area.",
